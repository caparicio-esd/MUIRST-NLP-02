Greece hasn't caused this flux of immigrants. Yet Greece is handling almost all of them. But Britain has had a significant involvement in the middle east and Syria to say the least.

0,"Not true Peter Bayliss. I am not religious but many gay people are because they believe God loves everyone.

Firstly, you should acknowledge the tremendous sacrifice Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey have made, despite being far less wealthy than Europe or the oil-rich Gulf countries. Secondly, if you are going to criticize Saudi Arabia and Co, you should also have the intellectual honesty to then also slam the only other democracy in the region as well, namely Israel. Israel has taken in exactly ZERO refugees from any country, including non-Muslim black Africans. These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are MORONS. Seriously? Let me get this straight: you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to - SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter. The Gulf States on the other hand are ruled by Sunnis, some having Shia minorities. And finally, some Syrians are in fact moving to Saudi Arabia in secret, provided they have plenty of money (I know this for a fact).",f9dc157212b

1,"This is a neo fascist/nazi party with no moral boundaries. The vast migration has triggered the swedish people to put their vote on them, but they have been around long before any immigrants coloured our white suburbs. As a swede who grew up with Palme and social equality, heartfelt solidarity and an unprecedented welfare-system, I am in agony and actually planning for future underground resistance or me leaving Sweden. I am not alone, most swedes are as concerned as me, but political uncertainty still makes SD the largest party among a lot of semi-big ones. There is no way that the Sweden Democrats (i.e. the nazi security service, SD) can lead the country or lead to anything else than surpluse lessons that Sweden never got to learn in WW2. Our country is just a couple of years away (elections are in 2018 and SD is now the largest party in polls, making them eager for a fast re-election and a fast take-over) from being hijacked by a malevolent ""party"" with a bloodline straight from the SS highquarters (evidence based, please check it out) in Berlin 1942. Check the sources and you will find it is for real. Sounds like sci-fi but sadly is not. In the 90's there was a political movement among the neo nazis that collected them with fascist forces. Street violence drastically fell and people experienced an eerie silence, going from neo nazis murdering and battering of those in opposition: homosexuals, immigrants, ""lefties"" etc, to an appreciated parliamentary movement. The SD, formed by old nazis in 1988, left the uniforms and sieg heils behind them and organized themselves in a ""political"" party, SD. Today, their accomplishments are uniting and focusing racist, fascist and nazi groups, spreading propaganda that supports and leads to racist murderings and arson. This will soon be everyone's problem, no matter nationality. So please – UN, GB, US – anyone. Help. Make sure that the World community does not accept a regime that stands against civil rights, free speech and democracy. Do not allow the worst parts of our history to repeat itself. Use the UN declaration of human rights to shed a light on this abomination!",c587d5f41c0

The State pension is the UK's single biggest expenditure, followed closely by other entitlements like housing benefit. This country bends over backwards to help the elderly and the homeless, and the little support that migrants and refugees get is but the tiniest fraction of that. You might say ""well, benefits all go to immigrunts"", but you'd be wrong, as 95% of the welfare bill goes to British-born. ""How many are terrorists"" - Well, seeing as all major terrorist attacks in Europe over the last decade were carried out by people who were born in their target country, probably zero. ""What about the frail and elderly"" - See the earlier remark about pensions. ""What about the veterans that are too proud to ask for help?"" - If someone doesn't ask for help, it's very difficult to give it to them, isn't it. ""What about the victims of floods in Cumbria?"" - Households that've been flooded are being given £5000 each by the Government, plus expenses for temporary accomodation. Many may also be insured. In spite of their current misfortune, Cumbria flood victims are in a much better position than the majority of refugees.

So 7k are placed in my city and state & the crime is immeasurable. Child killings, torture & abductions are higher than ever. Heroin & needle deali dealing is everywhere. Muggings, home invasions and school violence is uncontrollable and domestic violence, well its all day everyday. All this started within a month after the placement of the refugees into the US and 18 months after their placement is way at all just really started to tear down and it's just become a war zone in the state of Massachusetts.

1,"God loves everyone ... How can they say it? How can they know what God loves or what He hates as long as they don't read or study God's word - The Bible? Because this is a lie! It's true: God is love, He loves the people who listen to him and who have high moral standards! But if they read God's word they will discover what it says in Romans 1:26,27, for exemple, ""That is why God gave them over to uncontrolled sexual passion, for their females changed the natural use of themselves into one contrary to nature; likewise also the males left the natural use of the female and became violently inflamed in their lust toward one another, males with males, working what is obscene and receiving in themselves the full penalty, which was due for their error"". The Bible makes it clear that God designed sex to be engaged in only between a male and a female and only within the arrangement of marriage, just like Genesis 1:27,28 says. I don’t hate homosexuals, but I can’t approve of their conduct. I reject homosexual conduct, not people. Also, I can't approve ""God loves everyone"" under these circumstances! Jesus didn’t encourage his followers to accept any and all lifestyles. Rather, he taught that the way to salvation is open to ""everyone exercising faith in him."" Exercising faith in Jesus includes conforming to God’s moral code, which forbids certain types of conduct - including homosexuality. I respect all sorts of people, but the argument or the justification ""God loves everyone"" hasn't been used right. Someone can say ""but this is love..."", well, I say IF YOUR LOVE FOR GOD AND FOR HIS PRINCIPLES IS BIGGER, THEN SURELY YOU'LL FIGHT FOR TO ABANDON THIS IMMORAL LIFESTYLE.",7dc20efb7d6

Have you ever talked, like actually had a decent conversation with someone who's trans? Here's a secret; you might have interacted with one without even knowing. Transgendered and lgbt people have to handle hate, discrimination and sometimes violent acts towards them. And most still stay true to who they are. If that's not being strong and capable of handling conflict then I don't know what else to say. And yes, I haven't fought in a war, but it's not people who identify as transgender who are going to ruin the chances of winning a fight/war.

But there were not enough for all of them. 15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel. 16 And the elders of the assembly said, “With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left? 17 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said, “so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 18 We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath: ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’ 19 But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh, which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.” 20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, “Go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife. Then return to the land of Benjamin. 22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, ‘Do us the favor of helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath because you did not give your daughters to them.’” 23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them. 24 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.",68e9fd5e3ce

Your religion requires total submission, shames women, doesn't allow them to make free choices.

1,"1. I don't worship a pedophile. I respect and adore a prophet. Placing him into the category of a pedophile is beyond pathetic as he lived 1400 YEARS. 1400 years. People change in 1400 years. In the future, people would call us pedophiles for marrying people at the age of 20-28. That's the problem that you don't seem to understand. It was a norm to marry women at a young age. How can I call someone who lived more than a thousand years ago a rapist if it was a normal thing for EVERY human on the planet at that point to marry young females? Marriage is also a choice in islam. I'm a young woman yet my parents don't force me to marry at a young age. THAT is culture. A culture that has ruined the true image of islam by mixing its own blend to make islam look ""nice"" for them. But it isn't. 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war). However, that doesn't mean that a man can just randomly go get a second wife just like that. He has to ask his first wife and if she agrees (nowadays a i doubt that), he has to go through his finances so he knows that he's able to take care of a second. I doubt even more that there will be a woman that would want to share their love for a husband with another which makes it harder for a man to find a second wife. If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. Also, nowehere in the quran does it state how many husbands a woman can have but yes it does say a man can have 4 wives. For women, it would mean that she could marry as many as she pleases (though WHY would a woman wanna do that? I don't wanna have more than one husband and I know for certain that we would enjoy putting our efforts and love for one guy and not many and men would not enjoy having to share their love for one woman but some regions in the world have different norms (which i'm TRYING TO POINT OUT because the prophet and those who lived with him existed in a different time with DIFFERENT norms). Today we have somewhat the same norms but because of differences in timeline, we change alot for the better but know that we can follow the same norms. It's just that it's very important to make everyone and God happy . 2. Slavery is allowed but we rather call it housekeeping as slavery basically means a slave being owned to a master and does everything that the master tells him to do. Islam is against that as it says that all ""slaves"" should wear the same clothes as the master, eat at the dinnertable with its master and to not be forced to do work that is beyond their strength...kind of sounds like a familymember to me. You're not allowed to rape anyone because that is considered Zina: an act that is forbidden by Allah. And the whole marriage by 4 women but women can only marry 1 man: I don't remember exactly but it was something to do with there being more women than men in our world (because war).

If men aren't capable of taking care of one wife (as it says in the quran but you don't seem to care about that), the man MUST settle with having one. 3. You want to know the positives that Islam has brought 30 YEARS FROM NOW? You weren't being clear with your point as you challenged me to state the positive things that Islam has brought to the west. I did but you are so reluctant to holding on to your opinion because 30 years ago, many ARABIC countries, not islamic, ARABIC countries decided to rebel against their leaders, resulting in new leaders and more rebellious groups are formed to overthrow the leaders. They use anything that is necessary to take down the leader and when they do, they have NO IDEA on how to govern at all. Are these muslims? Of course not. If strongly hold on to your actions and blame people when clearly there were better options (peace deals), then you're not a muslim. You're an idiot. Ignorant idiots. 4. The BIGGEST issue that I have with people criticizing isla m is that they point out issues with countries and how they govern. Both sides (the west AND ""muslim"" countries) are doing everything they can, knowingly and unknowingly sabbotaging the religion that once stated that through knowledge and peace, there will be victory. The problem isn't interely muslim countries, it's nationalism. It still exists and is the main reason why many have such hatred and rage towards others. even countries considered ""muslim"" have a grudge against each other (look at Saudi Arabia and Iran). Islam is a religion that unifies people, wether colour, race, sex, age or ethnicity. All it takes is an open mind and you might learn things beyond the screams and echoes from the media. I have watched Christianity and its history, I have seen the issues with Zionism vs Judaism, I have heard of people who believe in Buddhism but do terrible acts against others. WE humans are responsible for OUR actions and what we bring forth to our religion. Islam is always waiting for people to listen to it but many have always glared behind for other things and sometimes turned their cheeks. I CAN BRING a good image of Islam and I can also BRING a bad image of it aswell but Islam as a whole is never changed. It stays the same. Only I can become distorted or bad. THAT is why you see muslims bombing themselves and killing in the name of God: They are enraged, confused and don't know about Islam. When you live in a place where foreigners (US) have bombed, destroyed unity, taken their properties and placed terrible leaders there, what are the odds that you end up becoming confused of the situation, just like many, and do everything necessary to take back the good times. Suddenly you get it back but what CAN you do? You don't know how to govern, you know how to fight. All rebellious groups start out well, fighting for justice and then suddenly along the way, they become confused and even mad with power and strength that God has given them, only to use it to hurt others and blame God for that. There is a problem in these places but to solve it, PEOPLE NEED TO STOP BALING EVERYTHING ON ISLAM AND GET THEIR BUTTS OFF OF THESE PLACES and I'm talking mainly about the US. PS: My religion is MY choice but just like you have your choice, I wish to respect it and the same should go with you.",3fb9e9640b2

0,"did I say that? Don't put words in my mouth. I am talking about the political party - not the voters. I believe people voting this party are blinded by their incapacity to put themselves in other people's shoes - which makes it harder for them to recognize the bullying that is going on against immigrants in Sweden by this political party (mostly muslims, but also people like me, which I believe gives me the right to be angry), but that doesn't make them racists, just self-centered. And yes. I do believe 20 percent of the population is self-centered because to me there's no other explanation. I would get angry if you were treated that way, the fact that you don't, makes me question your moral. But since you're here, if you want to learn how to recognize the bullying, here's an example: just read the guy below you. I personally encounter people like him every single day. Words like his no longer hurt, I've become used to them as I believe many others also have. But I do fear him and it makes me feel uncomfortable to know people like him exist and are walking freely on the streets. I worry for my kids safety. My nine year old son was recently pushed by a 30+ old man, for absolutely no reason other than him walking right next to me, holding my hand as we passed him while exiting the store. The man had a sticker on his car that read ""Keep Sweden clean!"". He I do think is a racist. The day the voting ended giving the Sweden democrats 13% of the votes - a car drew by me, my son and my six year old daughter. A guy riding the passenger's seat threw a can at us and screamed ""SD, for fucks sakes! Out with the blackheads"" (blackheads referring to immigrants with darker features, like my dark hair - For those who wonder.) He was probably also a racist. I can give you a thousand more examples like these, all starting when SD began to brainwash people into thinking discrimination is okay by doing it themselves - regularely. But i won't sit here and spill you all my problems - especially since you're not going to relate. But I will say this; Most people in Sweden never used to be politically enthusiastic, it was almost taboo to talk about politics a few years ago. I remember being political and annoying people when bringing the subject up, because it was what they called ""boring"" and they said they didn't even worry about voting because accourding to them ""who cares?"". They would not even inform themselves about whom to vote and why, just vote whoever came to mind right there and then. Now suddenly it's a trend to express opinions and the same people who thought it was boring to do so are the first in line to vote for this particular party (not the only ones, but from what I've seen they are many). But since they never had that interest before, most of these people have no clue what they are talking about - even less understand how the world works or why things are the way they are. The result of that? Bad political judgement. The other day a spoke to a girl - SD supporter, who thought Syria was an african country, that they were fighting for oil and wanted to take Swedish oil next (let that sink in). Another girl said she didn't know who ISIS was but she knew he was bad. He. As in one person. I am not saying all SD supporters are like this, but quite a few are and it's seriously terrifying. With all this said, answer if you like - I'll read it and evaluate what you have to say in that case, but don't expect another answer - I might, just don't expect one, because neither of us will convince the other and it would be pointless to continue. I just felt like emptying my chest this once and now that's done. Signed: A rat born in a stable (a term used on me by SD supporters several times for having been born in Sweden).",e4665784691

0,"I agree Vedran, but that is a bit like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted out and run through all your neighbours corn fields... My real solution would be to make the refugees do what they are supposed to do. The countries in eastern Europe, such as Croatia, Hungary etc are now in a no-win situation. If they follow international law, they are required to register every refugee as they cross the border. Once registered the relevant State assumes responsibilities for their general welfare - but the refugee is not then free to move on somewhere ""better"", so the State is potentially stuck with a crisis of it's own. However, the UN foresaw that problem way back in the day, and came up with resettlement - where nations agree to legally relocate refugees away from the over-burdened countries - opening up the option of transfer to USA, Australia etc. Now, ideally this would have happened before that poor boy got washed up on the beach, but it didn't - instead the world reacted, Merkel opened her mouth to invite everyone in, and then slammed the door in their faces. Now, back to the no-win situation facing eastern Europe... they should close their borders and register people - but then the world says they are inhumane. Even the UN are criticising them for (apparently) doing the right thing. They can't send the refugees back down the line to Turkey, and the next country up the line won't let them in... So whereas my post was in jest, some of it was actually the most realistic solution ... let the ""refugees"" currently on the move get to the countries equipped to process them but then do everything as it should have been done in the first place, namely register them and resettle as necessary (or call on the UN to help with the financial burden of camps etc.) At the same time stop the initial migration away from the official camps in bordering countries. And above all, remember if they want to be thought of as refugees, the plan should be to get them all back home to syria again... not building a new permanent life somewhere ""better"".",563f3efb1a0

Wouldn't you agree? Then wouldn't it be possible that your current moral compass is misaligned? Second, whose God are you referring - surely you're not qualified to speak upon his/her behalf? Please do not hide behind religion - be straight forward and state these as your opinions. This way it's much easier to attack you instead of looking like a atheist. Nothing against God, just you. Third, assuming you are capable of intelligence, like we all are, then have you ever once tried to take a pragmatic approach to your beliefs (aka consider its practical implication)? Or are you just regurgitating the content you were force fed? Seriously, sit down and think: if homosexuals are really destined for hell anyways, what's the point in wasting your time on a Facebook comment section? Are you contributing to the ultimate good?Can't you just go about your day and revel in the fact that you're living the righteous life? Fourth, filth?!

1,"Put aside economy and what ours politicians talking, every country has that problem... We all know that this kind of refugees travel throught the countries just like that... even german chancellor knows that.... I'm or we are not contradicting - You forgot Eszter that before you close border there were agreement that Croatia will be transit country ( are we?) and that you all the time untill you close yor border WERE TRANSIT, no one around you made a problem to you for refugees because we heard all kind of news from Hungary, good and bad, register and not register - but, I repeat - you were transit all the time. Croatia is not in the same situation - we are surounded with countries who close border and not allow refugee crossing... EU just can't expect of us to do job what we all had to do from the beginning and we can't accumulate refugees in Croatia because suddenly all of you find out that is a bit too much of them. I'm contradicting? Europe is thought to cheat Croatia again and turn Croatia into a ""collection center for refugees"" - because what else will mean close all borders around us and suddenly the EU rule - no new corridors? You forgot - Hungary had open coridor during the long period before closing border!!!! I have a right not to be contradicting because I'm not - I have the righ to be very angry. Solution for a problem is - all states can open border and one rute can go through Hungary, one through Croatia... or we all can help Greece to close land and sea borders or.... there is many solution but no will. Eszter... Hungary as a country is a great, I really have nothing against you and I just even admire border act you done but this just not right toward Croatia.... We are also knows read and listen when foreign politicians or common people talk and we know add up 2+2... Closed border around us, EU rule - no new refugee coridor... we must be stupid enough to not figured out what that all mean!

If this is suddenly an issue for you, then where are you on the following which will/can disqualify you from service: ADHD Needing insulin shots Having bad teeth Color blind Bad eye sight Having flat feet Depression I could go on and on, the list is quite extensive. Here's the thing, the military views the effectiveness of soldiers on their cost. It cost money (tax payer money at that) to pay for soldier X's insulin or soldier B's ADHD meds. If they don't take their meds they are a liability to not only themselves but to the other soldiers around them on the battlefield. Being on extremely expensive hormone therapy can cause extreme side effects including osteoporosis, fatigue, increased risk of diabetes and heart attacks/strokes, weight gain, decreased muscle mass, anemia, and memory loss. So not only an expensive treatment, but potentially extremely expensive side effects...I haven't even touched the possible mood swings and other behavioral effects which again would be all on the tax payer's dime. So the military isn't going to pay for your possible surgeries or your drugs, much like it won't for a multitude of other things. So before you get your panties in a bunch, why aren't you out there protesting for the ""rights"" of colorblind people? The answer is cause it's not the hot topic of the moment. The military isn't your social experiment, and for all it's faults it may have I can't see where you would classify this any differently then trying to maximize effectiveness.

1,"You base your entire life around a book full of talking animals, unicorns, and magic lol. You have ZERO right to talk about what's ""natural"" or ""moral"" when you're a part of a religion that to this day oppresses, rapes, lynches, tortures, and murders hundreds of thousands- particularly in Africa where innocent people accused of being ""witches"" are barbarically burnt alive while the murderers praise their god all the while and lesbian women are violently gang-raped. Your religion is barbaric and depraved and you worship a blood-thirsty god that slaughtered a group of children simply for making fun of a prophet's bald head. There's not an iota of ""love"" or ""compassion"" in your religous extremism and the fact that the majority of the poor, violent, most oppressive 3rd-world countries are all highly religious (Africa, the Middle East, etc.) while the richest, safest, happiest, healthiest countries with the most human rights are all highly secular (USA, the majority of Europe) attest to the how damaging religious mania can be. You can stick to being a slave to a hateful, oppressive, and murderous deity, but for those of us fortunate enough to live in a free country, we'll continue believing in whatever the hell we want, loving who we want, and living our lives as WE- not you or your Bronze Age death cult- see fit. It's not surprising that a Christianist wouldn't understand the basic concept behind consent- that being that rape, murdee, and molestation- things that the religious practice in much higher numbers than any atheist or agnostic- are in no way comparable to a consenting couple of the same sex loving each other. You people don't understand consent because everything your bible stands for lies in direct contradiction to freedom and with that, consent. That's why your bible approves of slavery, theocracy, and forcing rape victims to marry their rapists, because it is built upon a disgusting, violent, and regressive idealogy that encourages its followers to be sociopathic monsters that attack, oppress, enslave, and murder, all under the mantle of Christian ""love"". Your country is in a bad enough state- what with the constant lynchings, entire villages bludgeoning and burning innocent people- including defenseless children and the developmentally disabled- to death for perceived slights, rampant rape, extreme poverty, disease, famine, religious extremism, and corrupt government- without you people being concerned with what other people are doing in the privacy of their bedrooms or what's between their legs. If religionists focused on their OWN lives and on making this world a safer, better, more loving place to live instead of filling their own pockets, spreading hatred and encouraging violence against anyone who dare live outside their regressive idealogy, and playing false prophets and miracle worker to fool the ignorant masses, they might be able to begin making a positive impact, but since that's never going to happen, your mantle of ""love and compassion"" is a false one. Oppressing, raping, assaulting, torturing, condemning, proselytizing, shoving your beliefs down everyone's throats, and murdering isn't love. It's blatant hatred and abuse done under the mantle of ""Christian compassion"", but it's anything BUT ""love"".",17c68d4b2f7

0,"Jane and Lee. There's a couple of things. 1. People's sexual habits are quite a small part of their sexuality. There is a history, a culture, a vocabulary all born from oppression which is part of our individual and collective identity as an LGBT community. When you reduce someones identity to sex you objectify them and begin to dehumanise them. It's a common mistake and one that many LGBT people make as well, but try to think of this articles in terms of people's experience rather than their sex lives. 2. There is a common oppressive discourse that gay people (men specifically) are peadophiles. I know you're not suggesting this in your reference to peadophilia but even using the term in the same sentence implies a connection. That is oppressive, if you don't want to offend LGBT people stop referring to peadophiles in any context wen talking about LGBT people. 3. Straight people don't need to come out, everyone presumes your straight, be thankful for this. Coming out is scary and sometimes has a negative result for the person doing the coming out. 4. Getting on with our lives and living and let living is not about ignoring difference, it's about celebrating diversity. So pretending homophobia doesn't exist and 'we are all in it together' is difficult for people that have experienced oppression. Ya'll have a good day now xx",2268a5f9b60

Croatia is carrying the illegal immigrants to Hungary (as Serbia did it before) - daily more than 10 000 immigrants. Croatia doesn't defend its border, they don't deserve the membership of the EU. That's the Southern Slav mentality. (when they should do something, they don't do anything - as it happened so many times in the history) Hungary is the only country that keeps the rule of Schengen. We register and supply the illegal immigrants. We ensure that there isn't humanitarian catastrophie. The European Union let us again alone. It takes daily 1 billion Hungarian forint but we don't get any support from the EU. As the fence will be ready from Serbia to Slovenia, Hungary closes the border again and nobody will enter to us. Approximately 2000 Hungarian soldiers are building the fence and 3000 police officers look after the order. It would be nice if you reader from England, Germany, France and from all the countries of the world, never forget which country was the only tower against the illegal muslim horde!

The problem is more to do with the fact that a great deal of rroma/gypsies are conservative themselves and want their traditions preserved.. which unfortunately and truthfully, is only hurting those who want to learn and improve their situation in life. Though it's true a lot of Romanians have put gypsies down because of their reputation for being criminals, which doesn't help the (potentially) good ones change their situation either.",35afeecd4a3

Immigrants are doing jobs which a lot of people don't want to take rather they are sitting unemployed or taking sickness benefits. 3.Cab and buses drivers are paying taxes and contributing their role the in country's economy not sitting at home and taking benefits. 4. Educated immigrants are playing a vital role in Hospital and pharmaceutical departments. 5.I.T sector is another example where immigrants are not only helping the growth of the well-renowned companies but also bringing the innovative conceptions and ideas. 6.Food and pizza- Restaurants are mostly run by immigrants bringing international cuisine and taste in the country.

People in Sweden should start taking stands on this topic before they adress any political issues or agendas. If they dont understand how we got here (shamanism and DMT use) there really is no good idea to listen to them as they have no understanding at all what they are doing. If you watch the videolist I shared you will notice that these problems in peoples minds will be solved when the get the medicine they need. Also people may start knowing a little bit more about the real world other than the cultures they enjoy and live in as time/money, materialism, christmas, easter ect. What every human should know about is Shamanism, DMT, Ayahuasca, Psilcoybin, Religion, Christian gnostic. Conciousness. For me its very obvious that humans became humans by eating psilocybin mushrooms. Mushrooms are the largest organism on earth and has been here for over 500 million years, so life could have been seeded on this planet by mushrooms spores. The psychedelic experience is the origin of all religion, meditation is techniches without any ""tools"". Before Christ there was the Elusian mysteries.

0,I think immigration does have its benefits. Also as an English woman living abroad I'd be a hypocrite if I thought and said differently. I live in Anguilla it's a British Overseas Territory in the Eastern Carribean. I'm here because of my husband's job. He specialises in a field that the Island needed and didn't have. He has full residence status as long as he works for the Government. I on the other hand as a wife have an extended permit to stay the length of his contract. With big words saying Prohibited from working. So any UK citizen like myself are prohibited from working yet any citizen of this Island can can go and live and work in the UK. There are no equality laws here and its only by being away from my homeland that I see how we are protected by laws that are beneficial to society and economy of the UK.

Education does change ideals, and like I said, it's what I have seen work. Like I also said, I don't have a solution. I'm just sharing what I've seen. My mom started out in a very religious, though not extreme, home. She was the first girl to go to school in her family. After going to school, her view became more modern. She broke off from the idea that women are only supposed to be serving men. I'm sorry if that's not the response you wanted. The current situation is a delicate one. Handle it the wrong way and you end up creating more extremists instead of diminishing their numbers. To answer your next question: I do believe all nations have a right to protect their citizens from any sort of threat. But how to deal with that threat is another issue. All in all.. Just because I am Muslim doesn't mean I am equiped to provide solutions for this situation or any similar situation . I can only tell you my experience.

Neoliberal ideology has failed to deliver economic results because it is based on the false dogma of the self-regulating market. Since the market is supposed to regulate itself and the government can only save money and grant tax breaks to the rich (which is also a form of state intervention and another proof that self-regulating market never existed and never will exist), competition between parties in terms of different economic polices doesn't exist, hence the crisis of democracy. Moreover, the middle class has been declining and feels hopeless, but because they have been brainwashed into believing that the state can do nothing and poverty is people's own fault, they need to find a scapegoat.

Judges 11:29-40 29 Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. 30 And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If you give the Ammonites into my hands, 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.” 32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. 34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of timbrels! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.” 36 “My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. 37 But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.” 38 “You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. 39 After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin.From this comes the Israelite tradition 40 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.",445d20d7cde

How many Syrians have you taken in? How many bombs have you dropped? I certainly agree that some of what SD representatives come out with is atrocious and racist; but the core issue that the party represents is one that shouldn't be - yet is - overlooked. When mainstream parties refuse to listen to their electorate, opting instead to classify their opinions as markers of fascism, the result is a surge in the popularity of fringe parties. If our government - or indeed parties in the opposition, such as the Moderates - had actually taken this issue seriously, we wouldn't be in a position where the latest poll shows that SD is now Sweden's biggest party. But they don't listen, and they pride themselves on ensuring that Sweden is seen as the best, most open and tolerant country, instead of actually ensuring that we can look after the people to whom we give asylum. The result is that we take in far too many asylum seekers who have no option but to live in tents in the freezing cold. That's not humane, and it's not democratic.",6e4c886a42f

0,"Here are some thoughts from the Croatian perspective regarding the ongoing migration situation. In short and simple words, the problem derives from the following assumptions: 1. Migrants are fleeing from the ISIS and middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece without being checked; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel, as at the time Germany saw a chance to seek cheep labor force; 4. Hungary erects walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece or Turkey. Were they registered in Greece? No! They either stayed in Turkey (circa 1.8 Mil) or moved forward to Europe. There is nowhere in the EU or international law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. Number of refugees heading for Germany exceeds German needs, so it is possible that they will no longer be welcomed in Germany. This means that they will stuck in Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia, waiting to be properly registered and transported to other countries (e.g. USA and Canada offered no more than 130.000 places). At this point it is clear that all countries en route to Germany are not conforming with the international law requirements. The only way for Croatia to deal with the situation is by simply transferring them as soon as possible to the end destination. Unlike Hungary, Croatia does that humane. Well done Mr Milanovic. Last and most important - this migration problem cannot be handled by one country by itself. The problem needs to be resolved politically within the NATO, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS. With the emphasis on ""full scale"" and ""military"". Bottom line is - all countries must cooperate and stop blaming each other or the US. We all have the same problem; we need to assemble and start taking actions against ISIS and terrorism.",7b9a94bd899

The truth is we don't know why there are such problems within the transgender community but we can't risk the security of a country because of these problems until we conduct more research and find the real reasons, only then should we allow them to serve the military, when we know more",1716a6a72a8

The homosexuality that abounded did not exist in a vacuum, it was part of a lifestyle that not only allowed, but also encouraged vice and corruption. It was to this town that God sent Prophet Lot; his message was to worship God alone. However, embedded in worship are the desire and the willingness to obey God’s commandments?

0,"Well, there's quite a lot to answer there! I'll ignore the global warming red herring at the end (nice try, though, petal). 1. Genetically, there are 2 SEXES, not genders. ""Sex"" refers to biological differences (hormones, genitalia etc), whereas gender refers to sociocultural norms associated with sex. (See WHO's website for details; see also Pavlov 2014). Conflating sex and gender really is a schoolboy error (or is that expression not considered PC enough?) 2. The science isn't settled that being transgender is a mental disease. You're either deliberately misinterpreting the facts or have misunderstood them. 3. Johns Hopkins has recently reopened its gender clinic, and now performs gender reassignment treatments after re-evaluating McHugh's findings. 4. Citing McHugh alone ignores the scores of other psychiatrists whose findings differ greatly from those presented by McHugh (for example Colizzi et al, De Cuypere et al., and so on). 5. The methodology in Hopkins research was criticised for being flawed almost immediately after its publication. It judged patients to be ""poorly adjusted"" if they were involved in relationships with someone of the same sex post-transition. 6. Thepublicdiscourse is run by a far-right think-tank, and can thus be discredited due to ideological interference. Present a more neutral source and you might have an argument. 7. McHugh's findings can also be discredited based on ideological conflict; in 1992, he admitted that his goal was to have the gender clinic at Johns Hopkins shut down after taking it over in 1975, 4 years before his ""findings"" were made public. Isn't that a swell coincidence? (See McHugh, 1992). 8. Gender dysphoria (arguably an offshoot of ego-dystonic sexual identity disorder) certainly exists, but not everyone who is trans suffers from it. 9. You don't ""enable"" a mental disorder. They occur. Reassignment therapy can be seen as a form of treatment for those who suffer from gender dysphoria. 10. I actually agree that children should not undergo reassignment therapy, for the simple reason that their development has not finished, and thus it's possible that they may change as they advance through their teenage years. 11. Hopkins is but one hospital. Their policy is not representative of other hospitals where reassignment therapy has proven to be a success over a prolonged period. 12. You cite McHugh yet do not provide the name or coauthors of his work, nor do you explain the methodology. You're simply regurgitating the information that you found on a far right website. 13. Johns Hopkins were quick to distance themselves from McHugh, contending that his research doesn't represent their views. I'm sure that your life would be more fulfilling if you didn't waste it trying to make others miserable, babe. Oh, and ""liberal"" isn't really an insult, given that it means ""free"", although it speaks volumes about your own ideology and outlook. You take care now xoxoxo",0a8a1a5d693

Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” 7 “Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” 8 Jesus replied, “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. 9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”",9dcb1b729b5

ISIS would not be anywhere as powerful as it is today if western powers didn't illegally occupy iraq and completely remove all army personnel and councillors. Borders were left open and many ex-soldiers started working with al qaeda to fight the occupation. Al qaeda was non existant during Saddam's time. It simply wasn't there. ISIS is an offshoot of al qaeda. The west supported and financed al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. Also the west's attempt of removing bashar by supplying weapons to the ''moderate rebels'' in Syria was just stupid. A lot of these weapons ended up with ISIS making them stronger. We all know that the west supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is the UK's biggest purchaser of weapons.

Then you wonder why people flee and drown in the sea. It's the failure of a certain capitalist modality in large swathes of the world. Capital, a thing, is free to migrate anywhere, but humans are not. so, thank you all of you, bunch of murder apologists and defenders of your own oppressive barbaric regime in Britain. instead of attacking the Regime here and its criminality against its own population you are finding a scapegoat as it is an easy target demonstrating your complicity in barbarism.",53bd0aad599

1,"While racism is wrong , I can understand countries and nations with big & old history and culture such as Sweden have every right to preserve their own race, culture , history , traditions , language , democracy and so on ! They are not like the United States, Canada and other American continent countries (countries of immigrants that they stole from the original American Indians). Nor they are like the current or older colonists like U.K, France and etc. that have the responsibility to take in immigrants in from all those countries they previously colonized or those countries they have destroyed in middle east and Africa during their past or recent invasions and occupations that have left those countries ruined and their people running away as immigrants and refugees all over the world... Old countries and nations like Sweden, Norway , Finland, Hungry and etc. don't have to pay the ultimate price of getting their own respective countries ruined by immigrants that have no desire to assimilate into their cultures and people due to so many different reasons... These countries have every right to preserve their true national identities and way of life without being called racists and being condemned for it by immigrants and others in other countries. At the same time, they have to change their immigration laws accordingly and treat those immigrants they already let in with dignity and according to the rules of law!",ccf1a6852de

Sweden is not receiving waves of engineers, doctors, bankers, skilled tradesmen... most of these people accustomed to low-paying occupations such as street vendors, small store owners who go into debt to start a business in Sweden, and service/call centre workers. Many more are unemployed, some areas such as Rosengard in Malmo, there is >70% unemployed. Rosengard is a mostly Iraqi, Lebanese and Somali populated area. It's not all sunshine and lollipops Liberals vs. evil Neo Nazis. I dont believe in deportation whatsoever unless warranted. These people need to be educated and driven into more skilled occupations and better immersed into Swedish culture.

This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece. Where they registered there? No! EU law? Is there anywhere in the EU law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? No. And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. In the light of my points 1 to 4, all refugees heading for Germany should stay in Croatia and Serbia, because Hungary decided to build walls.

Conversation about how we want to be treated like everyone else (that is to say, love the ones we love, whether it looks like yours or not, marry who we want to, whether our choice in partner is what YOU and people like you would approve of), or to be able to exist without fear of an individual having real animosity towards us and doing something about it and being surrounded in those moments by people like *you*, who ""don't hate us"" but would be passive enough to keep us marginalized. How many? Have a guess? The point is, your ""science"" is flawed, and we've heard it all before. Your ""logic"" is hopelessly idiotic, and we've heard it all before. Your ""reason"" isn't fully fleshed out at all, and obviously has way more to do with emotion (ironic that, but not unexpected) than anything even remotely reasonable, and we've HEARD it ALL before.

I'm ""anti-accepting-illegal-immigrant"" and ""anti-arbitrarily-labeling-illegal-immigrants-as-refugees"". To give you an example: we're bringing 25,000 Syrians into Canada and I'm quite happy about that. The most important thing though is that they will enter legally, with proper checks and naturalization through immigration authorities. So even though the media are having their little jamboree orgasm clasping on the term ""refugees"" into Canada (LOL), they are in veritable truth LEGAL IMMIGRANTS in this case, nonetheless; and whose tragic circumstances justify expedient, albeit legal, immigration should they please to do so. Most importantly, they are NOT seeking refuge into Canada away from war if they are departing from Turkey, unless they are air lifted or ferried straight from Syria, into Canada. In other words, they are NOT refugees even in the case of Canada. Do you find the term ""refugee"" sexier or something compared to ""immigrant""? because the term"" refugee"" applies only in specific contexts and circumstances. Does it connote more compassion in your view or something? Because I find it's being used as a blanket statement to force illegal immigration as something desirable and normal, which it shouldn't.

Basically people who are still in the dark ages, are still very much racist and well unwelcoming. I also suspect it is largely to do with the fact that they also come here to claim housing and welfare. FYI refugees in the UK and most Western European states are not entitled to any benefits. They receive a nominal amount of 15 to 20 pounds everyweek in vouchers and are given accommodation in a hostel. So seriously get off your high horse and before you preach hate look in the mirror. Read and get informed on the refugee laws... also check the statistics on the amount of EE workers who come here claim housing, benefits and work minimum wage jobs or alternatively work for cash in hand to avoid Tax payment. Those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.... also an immigrant or refugee who has qualifications and studied his/her butt off aren't stealing your jobs if all you have is a gcse and want to get out of bed at midday..... Also remember WWII this is where we will be heading if you don't curb and limit this horrid mentality and way of thinking... no one is saying open the boarders... one is suggesting vetting and to stop dehumanising fellow humans simply because of their background, ethnicity or religious beliefs.

In the past, the prophet and his friends fought because they defended. There are people out there, who proudly stand as muslims and protect their country from being destroyed from terrorists (The west AND the bombers). Why should they be marked as stupid or ignorant or a terrorist? I live in a country where there's a party that's the second largest.

Jesus Christ fulfilled God's Commandment of thou shalt not kill. He became the sacrificial lamb and died for everyone's sin. Jesus Christ reversed Moses' law on divorce and fulfilled God's Commandment of thou shalt not commit adultery. Again, the Old Covenant leads to the New Covenant. Jesus Christ did not come to change God's law. He came to fulfill God's Commandments. Jesus Christ condensed the Commandments into two: Love God with all your heart and love one another as He loved us. That's Christianity.

Far too many, too quickly, etc. And despite 'being persecuted and tortures' etc seem to have the energy to riot. Never mind all those men leaving behind their wives and children behind. Do people need to wait until these refugees declare Europe an Islamic state or can we now agree that refugees must be processed and must have papers. Of course as decent humans we want to help the unfortunate but when they literally invade in droves and we don't have resources to deal with it, we need to think of our own well-being. That is not racist not egocentric. It is survival, and we residents have just as many rights to survive as any immigrant or refugee. let me laugh, 1200 only and Croatia is already overwhelmed. That may be 10% of migrants arrived to Hungary. But ""mean"" Hungary should let them all in of course. The Croatian Government have invited the immigrants / refugees, like the German Government did to show humanity and „compassion” and after only a single day, Croatia has thrown in the towel and said to the immigrants Go back to Hungary because it's closer and they stuck the immigrants / refugees in buses and trains and they sent back over ten thousand people back to the Hungarian border. This means hypocrisy and complicity with immigrant traffickers from all Balkan governments from the region. First you bait them in by saying you're overriding Dublin III and are planning on accommodating upto 800,000, now you do a 180° and all of them are stuck in Germany and Austria they said they could recieve millions of refugees for years no problem and that the Crisis wasn't a crisis but a problem of the heart and all the uneducated and naive believed them.

1,"Deliberately ignoring refugees to allow spread of Islam in West: Saudi official ‘We’re letting them go to Europe, isn’t that enough?’ “We are ignoring the issue as a strategic maneuver. If these refugees go and settle in the west then they will take the beacon of light i.e. Islam, with them,” an official from the Saudi government said. “What we are doing is waiting for them to set up camp so that they can show these infidel nations how to save themselves from kufr,” he said. The current plan seems to be to let the refugees find homes in Europe and then wait to see what happens. “We already have a lot of Muslims here… we don’t need any more. We could give those white people some refuge if they wanted though,” the official said and laughed. Syrians have an exceptionally hard time migrating to Arab countries and are often denied entrance to begin with. “Look let us be honest it’s like asking a Muslim man to let a Hindu into their homes. We’re letting them go to Europe, isn’t that enough?” the official asked. “Even if we did let them in where would they live? It’s all sand here. At least they’ve got water where they are right now,” the official said and laughed again. Akhtar Al Hassani, an activist from the USA: “Islam is meant to take over the world,” he said, and added: “The Arab world will never let the refugees in so they have to go elsewhere.” Saudi Arab has released similar statements. Some Muslim countries have decided to block apps like snapchat, candy crush saga and temple run in protest of EU migration policy. “Europe can really learn a thing or two from the hijrat-e-Madina,” Hassani said of the crisis. Meanwhile, the reaction from Saudi Arabia has been lauded by many Muslim countries as being highly appropriate and on point. “We can’t take any refugees because… errr we have this thing going on,” a statement from the country said. “We are working on ensuring we don’t create too many refugees out of the Yemen war. Is that not enough?” the statement questioned in closing. It remains to be seen whether this outrage from the Muslim Ummah will result in building the kind of pressure that is needed to help resolve the refugee issue. Imam, Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem: “Europe has become old and decrepit and needs human reinforcement….they are not motivated by compassion for the Levant, its people and its refugees,” said Ayed, adding, “Soon, we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.” “Throughout Europe, all the hearts are enthused with hatred toward Muslims. They wish that we were dead, but they have lost their fertility, so they look for fertility in our midst,” he added. “We will give them fertility! We will breed children with them, because we shall conquer their countries!” Ayed stated that “whether you like it or not,” Americans, Italians, Germans and the French will be forced to take the “refugees”. “We shall soon collect them in the name of the coming Caliphate. We will say to you: these are our sons. Send them, or we will send our armies to you,” concluded Ayed. Ayed correctly outlines the fact that Europe is facing demographic disaster because its citizens have stopped having children. Italy’s current birth rate of 8.4 per 1,000 people is the lowest since 1861 and the picture is much the same across the rest of Europe, where population is only increasing as a result of mass immigration. Birth rates in the west are far lower than those in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most of the migrants are coming from. The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, “And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.” “To emigrate in the cause of Allah – that is, to move to a new land in order to bring Islam there, is considered in Islam to be a highly meritorious act,” Khabaristan Times KHABARISTANTIMES.COM",d1dde461db9

Unlike some people who pounced on me because I expressed my opinion freely although many people totally disagree with gay marriage & supposedly their opinions must be respected too ! Anyhow , homosexuaity is aberration , and homosexual behavior isn't natural for those so oriented . The orientation is a disroder and the behavior is pathological . Sexual preferance is cultural & environmental rather than genetic . There is a broad agreement that genes don't make it & genetic influence at most is minor . Individualistic reactions to random factors are very important . For example , divorce doubles the risk of later homosexuality in children . So social & family paths lead to it & the environment is much more powerful than genes in the development of homosexuality . Here , homosexuals are the victims of environmental problems and they are like patients who should get proper treatment .",e2e7b054a94

0,"Eszter - I will paraphrase a (very long) response I posted on Gergely Dian's comment thread.... Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe. 1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered. 2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full. 3) With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in... thus pushing the problem further back down the line. The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia. So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden. If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law. The solution I proposed was let those already moving go to Germany and register, and ensure those in camps or those leaving Syria stay in the camps and register. The UN will then be able to oversee their rights are upheld (shelter and food - even if that means camps in Germany, Austria etc.), or that the refugees are resettled as appropriate. However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution, and the refugees are able, and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity. {As it happens, the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }",845d4b7311c

I'll humour you with a few excerpts from the Wikipedia page to which you're referring: ""However, widely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult, which is why the UNODC itself caution against using their figures."" ""The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports."" ""Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases."" ""According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence. This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships, may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality."" tl;dr: Learn a little about data interpretation, don't reach conclusions based purely on assumptions, and always, always read texts/Wikipedia pages (at least the parts related to the subject of discussion) in their entirety; especially if you're using them as references to back up your claims.",9f253b3f383

1,"You have compared the Hungarian refugees from 1956 to the Syrian refugees. You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference. But it seems to me that at the present only we (Europeans) act tolerantly while they stick to their rigid customs. It is hard to imagine any real co-operation with them if they do not change their attitude.",40b40e2c32e

Furthermore if there's any kind of war, then America can sell weapons as well and it's a huge business. But I agree with you on that the superpowers should've left the Middle East alone!",1f89a75f100

0,"Food for Thought: One of my own misunderstandings, due to the structure of our society, was that we as followers of Christ should punish those who harm us. If the Church suffered apostacy early in the middle ages, then, it just may be that the early Christians followed Christ’s teachings even to the point of not pursuing civil punishment of those who harmed them. Christ’s teaching was “to turn the other cheek”, and forgive those who persecute you. We follow the tradition of Roman law because the traditional power structures of western civilization emerged from the Roman society. One of the keys to understanding how to have Christ’s power in your life may be to accept the actions of others without attempting to use civil government to punish the offender, which is accepted by scholars as a system of human justice implemented to prevent individuals from seeking revenge independently. Remember, Christ said, “judge not, that ye be not judged, I shall repay saith the Lord of Hosts.” No person will find it easy to ignore those who purposefully take advantage of them, but those who choose to emulate Christ, by caring for others, avoiding greed and materialism, and refusing to harm others may actually be able to call on Christ aid in time of need; this would be helpful when facing climate change.",bd0ec054dd1

0,"Yes. No one dismisses the statistics, it's the comparison between different countries that is misleading. The purely statistical rise in the number of rapes per 100 000 inhabitants in Sweden is partly due to legislative changes. Unlike before and other countries, we now count all separate incidents, and we have also gotten a much wider definition of rape. Besides those facts, more rape victims report the crimes than before. So. If we, like other countries, were to lump tens, hundreds or thousands of rapes together, we would indubitably have ended up further down the list. The same goes for if we, like other countries, would have a narrower definition of rape. Reality isn't what it looks like on paper – especially not in many, many other countries.

You know the saying ‘’Charity starts at home’’ is still true. The responsible way to help the ones in need starts at home. First take care of your needy, then go to the refugee camps and select those who deserve, who really suffered and get them on planes straight to Germany by the hundred of thousands if that’s what you want..

Begging is a very big annoying, unpleasant and ultimately harassing thing but you are mistaken if you think that the refugees will integrate quick and without any issues and be forever grateful to their European Savior. They are faced with bureaucracy right now, procedures and this makes them mad and feeling disregarded. They have some high expectations and a very different perception of Europe and what Europe has to offer. The idea that once the refugees together with their families arrive in Austria, Germany, etc they will have a job in a matter of hours/days is unrealistic. The reality of the matter is that the whole process takes time, and after what they have endured they don't have any more patience which is understandable.Contrary to what most of people think most of the refugees will despise their ""European Savior"" if we keep ignoring some core issues and congratulating ourselves for being so accepting.",4fa82b9a8f7

They're crying because the migrants' actions make them cry. Not the Hungarians, Croatians or Serbians, The migrants always use babies or little children as shields. How can they do this to those poor kids? And they're called 'refugees' by BBC...yeah some refugees these are.... There are leaders among them who tell the crowd what to do via megaphones.

If even the invaded, enforced don't reject Western cultures, what is your place to reject the other cultures? Superiority?

Sweden is a broken country by now and it's because all of our money goes to helping the immigrants. They just pour in and in and in and they become seggregated from the swedish culture and society. I grew up in a very ""diverse"" neighbourhood with Swedes and middle easterns and all sorts of cultures and races living side by side and we all got along fine. Why? Because they were assimilated into society. They didn't live in their own parts of the city, they didn't live in specific areas where the state puts them because there are no homes left for these people to go to so they just sit in their asylum waiting to get a job, waiting to be sent somewhere where they can start their new life, but it never comes because there are too many of them. Sweden can't take in any more because there's no space left, people have to realize that and stop calling every anti-immigration person a racist. Stop painting SD as some sort of radical nazi party because they're not. Only the politically correct idiots of the country who have nothing but good things to say about immigration think like that, because they have no idea how economics and assimilation work, they think that we can just take in the entire middle eastern and African population with no problems at all arising.

They like to blame immigrants for all their failures as the leadership. While people on the bottom fight and argue with each other (locals vs immigrants, whites vs blacks, Muslims vs non-Muslims), your elite is seizing power and removing your only real power which is spending power. They are pushing house prices out of your reach so there's fewer landlords to control, the rest of people are pushed into a lifetime debt (payday loans, massive mortgages for those who can afford them, student loans at £9000 a year, energy prices up by 10% every year, less national healthcare so you pay privately etc..). Do you really think that when you leave the eu (the only body that protects your rights from becoming peasants and serving the elite in 'new monarchy') will somehow magically change your country into a promised land ? Ever heard of foreign business, foreign investment, globalisation, British exports and what really drives UKs economy (finance and business management)?

0,"I realise that I look at things dfferently to others so here's my humble thoughts ... another way of looking at things. I am a mental health clinician and have contact with asylum seekers. I also see the struggles they have. These people want their home lands and their families, they don't want to be westernised and their culture made irrelevant. Many also suffer from PTSD and suffer on a daily basis. I had one man who was suicidal because he was unable to provide for his family in his home country and he could not contact family in UN camps apart from one member whom he was told would not be leaving the camp. This man cannot fit into a foreign society and do all he needs to to do this successfully when he cannot cope with his immense loss. IMHO I sincerely think we need to stop looking at these situations from our own points of reference and look at them from their perspective. What do they want and need. It's not being displaced and moved to foreign lands with little to no family. You see, cultures outside of western influence appear to value family relationships much more than we do. Look around us at our neighbours - the only extended families are those immigrants who could afford to come her and wanted to. Instead of putting a bandage on a haemorrhage, why don't we fix the problem. Instead of spending all that money to resettle people all around the world, why don't governments join together to despose those in power and causing this crisis. It wold make more sense to get rid of the problem and let people live in their country with their culture and family. I have much more thought on this but this is the gist of it. At the end of the day we westerners do what we would want, maybe we should ask what they want and need. cheers",759e0ece8fb

AND: It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: “The Messenger of Allah said: “…Whoever follows a path in pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise...

These people are of the belief that homosexuality is a sin in God's eyes and that a marriage union is only acceptable if it is between a man and a woman. Yet, we are all sinners, Christian and non-Christian teens alike, and God loves us all. Every single person, homosexual or not, is special in God's eyes. Sometimes it is about our own views of our behaviors that lead us to believe we are less special in God's eyes. If you are of a denomination that has deemed homosexuality as a sin, you may be faced with guilt about your same-sex attraction. However, it is your own guilt that makes you think that God loves you less.",14ebc4e9ad6

1,"Today is not a day to hate and it's assuredly not a day to rejoice over new ""freedoms."" Today is a day that I mourn. I mourn over a nation that calls good evil and evil good. I mourn over our nation that the world looks to that now, once again, takes the lead in leading the world astray. I mourn for those who say, ""This doesn't affect you so why do you care?"" because this does effect me, as I live in a nation coming under increased judgment, and because this does effect me, as my heart aches watching people drink sand in the desert believing it will satisfy. I mourn that God puts blessing and cursing before us, telling us to choose, and we time and again choose curses. I mourn over humanity who continues reaching to find satisfaction outside of Jesus but will never find it because there is no soul-deep satisfaction apart from the One who created us. ""There are many people outside the court today who are exuberant because they believe that what the court has done today will fulfill them and make them happy. Just like the woman at the well, who Jesus encountered, it won't do that."" I mourn for the true meaning of marriage being lost in all this, Christ loving the church and the church submitting to Jesus. I mourn for pastors and church leaders who, even though many still naively laugh at the idea, will soon face compromise or prison on this issue. I mourn for many followers of Christ who are tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine because of a lack of knowledge of God's Word and God's Will. I mourn for all those who boldly say ""Jesus loved all"" but don't understand that Jesus' love also called them to leave their life of sin and died a brutal death for our rebellion. And I mourn for the American church that either sits silently while the world collapses or screams hate from the sidelines. Yet today I am reminded that the Supreme Court can't put Jesus back in the tomb. Jesus is alive. He's still ruling and reigning. And He's coming back. How I ache and long for that day. But until that day comes I will continue to speak Truth, proclaim the Way, and show true Life. Jesus is the only answer for all our brokenness. Today I feel it more than most others - the Spirit and your true BRIDE say, ""COME LORD JESUS!"" AMERICA HAS FALLING",18642ad0d13

Sweden to become a Third World Country by 2030, according to UN: According to UN projections, Sweden will be a much poorer country by 2030, much worse than what anyone in the Swedish government indicates. The UN report HDI (Human Development Index) predicts a significant decrease in Swedish prosperity, unlike their Nordic neighbors, who will retain their top positions and even strengthen them globally in the long run. In 2010 Sweden had the 15th place in the HDI rankings but according to UN forecasts, Sweden will be #25 in 2015, and in 2030 on the 45th place. Sweden is one of few countries with such a sharp deterioration from what it had in 2010. Fewer ends up on welfare dependency in their Nordic neighboring countries while Sweden continues to have a greater amount of family households forced to live on welfare, which are a couple factors causing the dropped global competitiveness. Negative developments, or rather liquidations can be exemplified by Orrefors Kosta Boda, which in 1992 had 940 employees in Sweden and was a profitable industry. Today less than 100 remain in the company after further cost reductions and adaptations in order to meet global competition. Most of today's less developed countries such as Cuba, Mexico, the Baltic countries and Bulgaria according to the 2030 UN report will be passing Sweden in prosperity.

If they prefer Sharia Law, and live the life of Muslims then we advise them to go to those places where that's the state law. Russia does not need Muslim minorities. Minorities need Russia, and we will not grant them special privileges, or try to change our laws to fit their desires, no matter how loud they yell 'discrimination'. We will not tolerate disrespect of our Russian culture. We had better learn from the suicides of America, England, Holland and France, if we are to survive as a nation. The Muslims are taking over those countries and they will not take over Russia. The Russian customs and traditions are not compatible with the lack of culture or the primitive ways of Sharia Law and Muslims. When this honorable legislative body thinks of creating new laws, it should have in mind the Russian national interest first, observing that the Muslim minorities are not Russians. The politicians in the Duma gave Putin a five minute standing ovation.",7c212534fdf

This is why more and more national resources require privatisation according the government to save money, and why the NHS is being primed for this. Just as an example...provisional data shows that there was a net flow of 163,000 migrants to the UK in the year ending June 2012...163,000. That is it, and that was taken from a government website. That total is 0.2% of the population (i went for 66mil as the pop of UK). Its not the migrants using benefits, because a lot of them/the vast majority are very hard workers and contribute massively to this economy...its the British people who think they are entitled to benefits because of a history of 'family entitlement' or think that is how life works - draining the benefits system (which should be a safety net, not something to live your life by). Drainage capacity? Stop paying farmers to keep their lands clean and clear, and pay them to grow more trees instead, that would help. Reforestation is proven to help combat flooding...but that is something else the government won't do.

That’s the ""EU Agenda"" in a nut shell. Lets break this right down to the bare bones and look at it in a way the people on the high streets can understand. Looking back I remember going shopping for fruit and veg to the green grocers, for meat to the butchers. and for clothes to the clothes shop, for a tv or radio we went to the electrical shop. All these retailers got their products from many different sources all negotiating the prices and selling at their own price, i used to go from shop to shop and see and brows the produces and prices. Then came the supermarkets who started off selling foods, then clothes, then electrical, then medication, then insurances, then banking... Etc, etc.... Now we have the hated controlling Tesco and such like with stores not just in our country buy around the globe. They control the prices the farmers charge, the prices the clothing manufactures charge, the prices the electrical manufactures charge and so on and in turn they control what you pay and buy and how you buy and how you pay. Using Tesco as an example of one large organisation that changed the way every one lived and shopped and took away the individuality and freedom and choice from people and controlling everyone like sheep. TESCO... EU.... Can you see the pattern. Its always then the case and always will be where the few riches people in the world who are control and power hungry.

Refugees take what is offered to them until proper accommodations can be made for them. They do not demand ANYTHING because they are guests in another country. I did not want to believe it before but the more I see, I see this as an invasion. ISIS promised to reformation of the Caliphate. In their interpretation this includes all lands EVER held under Muslim dominion. Does anyone know their history? The last time Muslims ran across Europe in these numbers ended with the Ottoman Empire laying siege to Vienna 1683 September 11-12. ISIS interpretation of the Caliphate includes Spain, Sicily, and Europe the whole way to Vienna. Why are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and U.A.E. not taking these people in. They have more money than Europe and more jobs available. This has little to do with being Muslim this has to do with a mentality of being owed something. These people should have overthrown the Assad father and son instead of rallying for the downfall of the West for the last 50 years.

I like to think that the words capture nicely the essence as to the need for Pride events. WHY PRIDE? To celebrate diversity, love and tolerance To champion dignity, respect and above all else, acceptance. To educate against prejudice, ignorance and bigotry. To maintain the fight until these ills are banished to history. To reflect on battles won in the name of LGBT rights. To remember that more needs to be done. in order to scale further heights. So next time someone asks ""Why Pride?"" Look them square in the eye. Then reel off all those reasons before saying with pride ""THAT'S WHY"".",3e162e6b4c3

Islam (middle eastern and African style) is the single greatest threat to western civilization since the bubonic plaque. The west and Islam have waged war since the moors invaded Spain. As someone that values human life I can also testify that Islam does not recognize the right to life that is the most fundamental of human rights.

I hope you think about this? Whether you believe in Christ or not. Would he want you to celebrate him? He was in many aspects a refugee preaching. He was a man from Nazareth and Bethlehem. Many refugees are from that area too. And he took in everyone. He even preached for his enemies. I don't necessarily believe in God or Jesus myself but really we are all are eager to spend millions on our loved ones while people out there try to come to us after maybe Years with wars. Stuff most of Europeans can't imagine. I think he would rather say. And you lot complains these persons cost money but you spend 10000 of money on Christmas gifts how is that to celebrate me?

1,"Simon, I can see where you are comming from and there is a lot I can agree with you on. I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.",230be3bc4d6

0,"I agree that some contries are better equipeed at dealing with the situation but looking at the news from Germany they are seem to struggle at this point too. Anyway, my point is that a clear message should be sent that only refugees can go to Germany and the EU which may discourage people to embark on this journey at all. If they see that somehow getting to the EU will enable them to go to Germany they will try their luck. As much as I am aware of a train was stopped many times in Germany by pulling the emergency handle and migrants jumpped off the train and disappeared. How can you make sure that they will go back then? I still think that we can bring the ""equipment"" to the people rather than the people to the equipment. Costs less time and money. I am not sure if it was a really a terrorist or not so I cannot comment on that, I heard about it but I am really not sure how reliable the info is. There is certainly a risk and that is why I am saying stop everyone where they are and find out there and then. If the EU is one unit it doesn't matter so the funds and resources can go to where the problem is. I also think that Germany should take more responisbilty about the situation due to the message that was sent out (funnily enough that was a rather vague statment which now can be altered according to the situation - but lets move on about it) Than it is possible to talk about quotas and numbers. On Verdans point what I can see is that the communication between member states are really poor, everyone included, and this issue is highlighted it big time.",c7a32d4c09d

0,"From Sgt. Robert Brown US Army Nobody has a ""right"" to serve in the Military. Nobody. What makes people think the Military is an equal opportunity employer? Very far from it. The Military uses prejudice regularly and consistently to deny citizens from joining for being too old or too young, too fat or too skinny, too tall or too short. Citizens are denied for having flat feet, or for missing or additional fingers. Poor eyesight will disqualify you, as well as bad teeth. Malnourished? Drug addiction? Bad back? Criminal history? Low IQ? Anxiety? Phobias? Hearing damage? Six arms? Hear voices in your head? Self-identify as a Unicorn? Need a special access ramp for your wheelchair? Can't run the requred course in the required time? Can't do the required number of pushups? Not really a ""morning person"" and refuse to get out of bed before noon? All can be reasons for denial. The Military has one job. War. Anything else is a distraction and a liability. Did someone just scream ""That isn't Fair""? War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful. YOU change yourself to meet Military standards. Not the other way around. I say again: You don't change the Military... you must change yourself. The Military doesn't need to accomodate anyone with special issues. The Military needs to Win Wars.

I addressed this before. He's incorrect by doing so. He's just name calling and insulting people because it's the only way he can feel superior in his world.

1,"So their story is tragic, indeed, but goes as follows: after war in their country they flee to the nearest safest place due to force majeure and seek refuge, for example in Turkey, where they also have an international legal status as refugees. Then, they don't like it there, for whatever reason, even though they are perfectly safe as refugees, and decide to illegally immigrate and walk or are driven by smugglers for 1700 km across Turkey's land to subsequently cross the sea into Greece, putting in danger their own and their children's lives by bringing more unnecessary treacherous hardship and toil unto themselves, utterly and wholly of their own accord. Meantime the media still calls them euphemistically ""refugees"" ad infinitum, long after they have chosen to do away with their legal status as refugees given that they immigrate illegally to other counties without being in any immediate danger, in fact even though they do not qualify as ""refugees"" in any sense of the word once they cross Turkey's border into Greece, neither in the legal sense under all international treaties, nor in the etymological sense; simply because for at least 1700-1900 km of land maybe way more and a stretch of rough sea with the help of an illegal smuggler whom they themselves paid, they illegally immigrate into a country two or ten borders seat from the one they had initially sought refuge into. So the small question is why are the media still all calling them refugees after they reach Greece, when CLEARLY BLATANTLY they are NOT in any sense of the word, legal or etymological or otherwise (compassion is not an excuse for bad journalism of forging skewed opinion shaping public perception). Are you saying that they are running away from dire danger while they are in Turkey, to which they initially sought refuge to, qualifying the use of the term as refugees due to force majeure into Greece? And the big question is: there are over 2.5 billion people with similar or more tragic circumstances. Should they be allowed to immigrate illegally to any country they please? What about Somalian children and people in general? They actually have it worse than Syrians in all respects, plus they don't make demands for halal food. Wanting their life back which was destroyed by war is understandable. But so do another 2.5 billion people around the world with similar or worse circumstances. Should they all be allowed to immigrate illegally into Europe just because the media arbitrarily label them as refugees long after they are no longer refugees nor, in veritable fact, seeking refuge into safety not running away from any danger, perceived or real?",81a8ba22897

0,"I agree Craig McIntosh we have the same issue in Sweden, the problem is people dont like change, or strange things, or having to share. Many people also lack understanding, arent well traveled and hence immigration becomes this big evil that has to be stopped, and we throw these light fashist parties at the immigration to make the big bad thing go away. Even if imigration cant bet stopped, many countries have immigration to thank for what they are, even my country sweden during its prime in the 1600-1800 was built upp thx to foreigners, merchants from all over the world, craftsmen etc and others. I can agree that in many western countries the process of making a new arrived person blend into society painless isnt always working that well. Do we really need right wing extreme parties to solve that. It illustrates the need to education of people, politicians that are prepared to deal with issues, but also to work towards a society that is moore tolerant. Because the world today is in a period of change, much of the old order in the middle east and north africa are carving itself up. We have problems with more hostile neighbours in the east and people are emigrating in numbers not seen since ww2. Some people are also so fast to put numbers on other human beings, and this worries me, they would not do this towards one of its own, no matter what crimes or acts of evil they did, but an immigrant oh lord do they cost two bags of potatoes every month or will we taxpayers have to pay the ammounts of a lamborghini? It rubbs me the wrong way, and distract from the core issues with foreign policy, integration and the likes. Some have a tendency put even moore blame on the victims and its very dontraproductive to solve issues with imigration to begin with.",fbf9b6d3b2b

Israel has taken in exactly ZERO refugees from any country, including non-Muslim black Africans. These people have been called a ""cancer"" and horded into a literal concentration camp in the middle of the Negev desert. Where is your outrage? Third, you should all realize that you are morons. Seriously? -_- Let me get this straight, you expect people who are fleeing an extremist, fundamentalist version of Islam to go to Saudi Arabia, a country where people are beheaded in public places according to SHARIA LAW? Where women are forced to dress like ninjas and treated like virtual property? Seriously?!? Forth, many refugees are not Sunni Muslims or even just Muslims in general for that matter.

Also the annexation of Korea was koreas idea and we refused. Yet they wouldn't listen and assassinated Hirofumi Ito as he was in charge of the decision and he was against it. Don't you think it's weird Koreans think the murderer is their hero? They forced us to work on the annexation so we spent twice as much as their annual budget. Also during the annexation, we treat Koreans the same. No one was forced by the Japanese government and we have a lot of official documents and newspaper articles proving the point. Comfort women, the majority of them were Japanese and there were Korean ones but they were paid more than high ranked soldiers. With that they could build 20 houses per year. We also have that proof as well because of the bank. In 1944 America caught comfort women and on their official documents it says there nothing more than prostitutes.

0,"Again, please use logic, rather than falling back on Bronze Age fairytales. Murder and theft differ from homosexuality in many ways. The first and most obvious is that the former two have victims (and hurt others), while homosexuality does not (outside of STDs, which can and are also transmitted by heterosexuals). The second is that murder and theft are choices, whereas homosexuality is not. I'd like to make what should be an obvious assertion for the third difference: theft and murder are crimes, and homosexuality is not. Tragically, however, several countries are as caught up in their hateful religious dogma as you are, and so I'm unable to conclusively make that point. Instead, I'll posit that, in all civilised societies, theft and murder and crimes, whereas homosexuality is not. Even supposing that, of the thousands of religions, yours was somehow ""the right one"" (it clearly isn't), any God that casts people into hell for eternity for refusing to believe while simultaneously providing laughably limited evidence for their existence is not a god worth praising.

Insulting people's opinions to raise your own to prove you're right 3. The Islam faith is one like Christianity where Christianity dominates a lot of Europe and the western Countries in which Christianity went through destruction and death to get where it is today (referencing back to religious laws back then in European history, the Crusades, colonization and teaching the beliefs of Christianity using it for manipulation, etc). The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully). Many are dying yes, and modernization has let those extremists cause a lot more damage globally however, what must be kept in mind is that there are some who do need help. Ignoring a problem won't make it go away. Yes, countries like yours have internal issues to solve but without the world, globalization from countries other than yours, the country you currently live in wouldn't have developed into the way it is today. Which is most likely pretty modernized. Congratulations, you won the lottery ticket of privilege. Unfortunately others didn't. And you most likely won, as well as many of us, from immigration from the origin of our countries. The reason of immigration may be different for all of us but it's certain that we moved for the reason of a better life. If your family was denied to immigrate, you could've been in the Syrian's shoes or your descendants would have faced more issues while your origin county developed possibly ending your family line, meaning you wouldn't have been born.

What your first comment failed to understand is that being LGBT is not just about sex, it's about who we love and how we have lived our lives. I don't want myself or anyone else to have to go back into the closet because of fear on old age. Yes, in time attitudes will, are and have changed BUT even if all was perfect I have lived my life surrounded by my LGBT community and I would like to continue to have the chance to do so. We have a shared life experience as a community that will probably be even more valuable to me as I grow older. We make decisions about who we live with when we are adults, why should we have this taken away and treated like children when we are older? I also think many will take issue with you on ""sexuality going down the pan"" when you are old - is that your lived experience or are you projecting your feeling for a cause?",2fb6ad3e1e0

The end result will be that we'll a lot of the same obligations as an EU member without having all of the benefits and above all, no vote. We'realready paying billions into the cohesion funds for new EU members and into various other EU funded projects so we can still take part in the European free market. We're not that special anymore. The UK, while being 8 times bigger in terms of population, has a GDP that's only five times that of Switzerland. And as with Switzerland, most of it comes from the banking sector. While Cameron can currently protect The City from stricter banking regulations within the EU, that option wil evaporate once the UK leaves the EU. There will be no more leverage.

0,"Very one sided piece indeed. But like everything in life, there are two sides to a story. The arson at asylum facilities and the repulsive quote that drew all the clicks (let's face it) are appalling indeed. But this sort of social convulsion is hardly surprising during such a refugee crisis coupled with large scale terrorism. These are times when the bad guys got inside Europe together with the good ones who genuinely needed help. Everyone is scared and it's only natural that most people will turn against mass immigration under these circumstances. There are other factors such as the loss of identity a country goes through - a country with reduced population at that, which would see its ethnic composition warped, and the economic impact it would have. But for the most part, these people are worried about their country - a free, liberal, modern country with freedom of expression having its identity warped by the ascension of radical, intolerant forms of religion, by people who refuse to integrate and embrace another culture. This is maybe the biggest worry. It struck me how naive the reporter sounded (or maybe she has precognitive powers) when she said ""it has worked in countries like the UK"". Well, has it? Look at some things that happened in Luton not long ago. Let's wait another 20 years and we'll see if it really worked out for the UK.",b8bed74c300

0,"As with any issue today, public attitudes regarding Immigration and the EU are being determined by a mixture of general dumbing down and a total lack of attention span. A superficial, knee-jerk prejudice is easy to communicate in the snappy soudbites that the media and twitter has accustomed us to. Responding to those ignorant and misleading messages requires background, knowledge and information and a reasoned, articulated argument. People are just too lazy to read complicated messages these days, so they are naturally attracted to simplistic slogans and soundbites that convince them that issues are simple and the solutions equally simple. There is no such thing as a simple political issue and any politician who promises a ""cure-all"" like leaving the EU is a quack, however much he/she may say the things you like to hear. Anyone who believes that an exit from the EU will resolve more problems than it will create is as self-deluded as they are manipulated. The UK is an attractive country for immigrants because it presents a successful image to the world. The reality is that the UK is no longer a Political or economic power that is strong enough to stand on its own in relation to the massive interests of the US, China or for that matter the EU. The UK, outside the EU would fast become a political irrelevance on the Internatiional scene. Absurdly, it's exactly those naiive and anachronistic flag-waving patriots fighting for 'Britishness' that are least in touch with British culture today. I'm proud to be British, but my pride is linked to our Multi-ethnic culture as a whole and not some lame royal regalia or bowler-hat and pinstripe tourist nonsense. Our Multicultural society is one the few positive consequences of our colonial past, and Britain has every reason to be proud of having achieved the enriched society it has today. Our multicultural society s a far more accurate and rich expression of our Island's historical heritage than red telephone boxes and roast beef. By all means seal yourself off from the world and watch the country slide into irrelevance and economic meltdown, but that will be a consequence the UK would be entirely responsible for and not something you can lay at the door of exploited and marginalized immigrants.",8ed0f566978

This is a similar dicussion like the issue of abortion where some consider it murder while others a medical treatment. I think this is an insoluble problem which always triggering fierce dispute. Although I don't consider transgenders less capable of fighting and having weaker fortitude than others, I think that enlisting them to army would entail more mundane problems like bathrooms, toilets and so on but if any army wanted to accept them, it would tackle this small problem for sure. The problem is whether people with ""mental disorder"" should be conscripted into army or not. A man without legs wouldn't be accepted by army (although I am not sure) but it is visible disorder while transgenderism is a disputable subject.",d856ff3dd6a

I may not be in the military but I would imagine that everyone that does join has to go through some sort of basic training, so that they are prepared for combat as much as possible. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but if you can't cut it in training then they prevent you from entering into combat. So if a woman or transgender individual can pull as much weight as a typical male soldier and passed the same psych exams, then why can't they serve any role? Don't get me wrong, I acknowledge that there is a physical strength difference. But again, those who don't pass the test won't be able to serve in active combat, as it should be. Anybody who isn't physically fit or mentally fit should not be allowed. And for anybody that says transgender people are mentally ill, there are plenty of studies that say otherwise. If something is considered a mental illness, it usually has to effect the person who is suffering from it, from what I've seen so far, the only people suffering from this whole issue are the ones that for some reason or another hate those who are transgender, and yes transgender people suffer as well, but it is usually because of bigots and not because something they themselves have done.",7b864e2a9b2

0,"Hhhhhhh I am smiling! What a huge argument brought forward by Ty Royce Weldon. I would like to clarify a few points here. As far as refugees or refugee crisis is concerned, It is the laws of the European Union and the west that allow refugees enter into their territory. The same happens in the US. Mr. Ty Royce Weldon has criticised Islam strongly. Either he does not have complete information regarding it or media has brainwashed him strongly, because media shows him only what is seen by the eyes of the camera. In reality Islam never says you must force someone to convert to Islam, never allows a person to kill another human being, never allows to steal from another person, never allows to even enter the house of another person without his permission, etc. We need to respect the opinion of one another rather than critcise a whole religion. If we are used to the media and the media says that suicide bomber was a muslim from this so-called country, we directly believe it because seeing is believing, however the media never said that he was given a million dollars to carry out this bombing in a certain state, either european or asian, or that he was bought by ten million dollars and a ferrari or citiZenship of a specific well developed country. There are thousands of thousands of immigrants and refugees in Europe and the US who have embraced the customs and laws of these regions and who have never tried to impose anything upon a European or an American. I hope Mr. Ty and his followers in this argument would now agree with me. I am available to answer any questions you may have. I am a Writer in reality.",77728941b8e

Muslims led many invasion in the past but they no longer need armes to invade Europe. They just need an army of young men to ""entre"" Europe and that will be it.

They don't show the many forces people with severe mental health issues because of the atrocities they've experienced. No they show the fun, the adventure the excitement, the promise of a career and good pay. They're just as evil. And as for this man on the video and others like him. They are not teaching Islam, they are ISIS, they are terrorists who hide behind the name of religion, hide behind Islam to carry out their evil acts. The sooner people understand and see this the sooner people will leave religion and religious people alone. A truly religious person does not harm others.

Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight. The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted. The LORD replied, “Look around at the nations; look and be amazed! For I am doing something in your own day, something you wouldn’t believe even if someone told you about it. I am raising up the Babylonians, a cruel and violent people. They will march across the world and conquer other lands. They are notorious for their cruelty and do whatever they like. Their horses are swifter than cheetahs and fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their charioteers charge from far away. Like eagles, they swoop down to devour their prey. “On they come, all bent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind, sweeping captives ahead of them like sand. They scoff at kings and princes and scorn all their fortresses. They simply pile ramps of earth against their walls and capture them! They sweep past like the wind and are gone. But they are deeply guilty, for their own strength is their god.""",892724bf1fe

1,"One can easily understand why people feel that there are problems in Sweden, because - there are, people are afraid and Sweden is taking in too many people, but what can you do? Abandon your humanity and leave people to suffer and eventually die? To lead a country is difficult, it's a tough balance between doing the right thing as a human being whilst trying to do what's best for the future of the country. I'm not pro SD, rather the opposite, I understand why it has become like this though, it is because we pour in people into the country, and well yes some swedish people are stupid. There's an issue here, a BIG one - this video is stupid, it should consider the rest of the countries that do not accept as many immigrants, they're the real anti-humanitarians. Cause and effect... If you don't take in any people, of course people don't make a racist-party full of morons. Sweden need a big change in politics, but there are no reasonable parties up for election regarding this matter - therefore, people that are misguided and afraid also choose to vote for this party. If there was something in between things would look a lot different - other parties are too afraid to look into these questions whilst SD does - that said, it's a necessary evil having this party right now, so that the other understand the need of the people.",ad3f0338868

But looking at the comments I am glad to see that most people cannot be mislead and started to realise how the media is trying to influence them. Also well done for explaining what is happening in Hungary, without going down to a certain level.

The LIBLABCON are so desperate and clueless they ignore the newcomers abuse of women, abuse of children, and hatred of Homosexuals. They say nothing of Muslim women forced to cover up, because in Islam women are the property of men and seen as sexual beings who need to be controlled. What happened to the rights of women and feminism? Muslims slaughtering a load of young people at a concert in Paris, leaves the LIBLABCON punch drunk their revered immigrants killing people instead of been compliant and just so grateful. Sweden, once one of the most safest countries in the world, has now become the rape capital of the world, directly because of Islamic immigration.

1,"No multiculturalism = no inter-ethnic violence. I don't support violence against foreign people, but I also think that immigration is its own problem. I disagree that the US and UK are successful multicultures - they are largely segregated, and they seethe below the surface. Some support immigration while others oppose, but those who oppose are pressured into silence. I've recently moved to Japan on a work assignment, and there are very few foreigners here (Japan is 98.5% ethnically Japanese, even Tokyo is only 3% foreign). Some foreigners say it's a xenophobic society, but it's also one of the safest, cleanest, most prosperous and technologically advanced places you'll find anywhere. I question whether this would be possible with large numbers of refugees or other immigrants, particularly from countries where poverty is the norm and values are dramatically different. The refugee situation in Europe would be different if there were a clear plan to send people home at some point in the future, but there isn't, and as such, Europeans are faced with the prospect of being forced endlessly to absorb ever more people from broken nations, which will eventually make them minorities in their own lands.

Gender figure also plays a great deal in this, what other people in you society expect your gender to be like, to behave like. That's where shrinks come in, digging their way through their mind and emotions and trying to figure it all out. The undeniable truth is that it is a long and painful and difficult path, no one decides to be a transgender overnight or just because he fancies high heels nad beads.

Let me explain: currently you can't JOIN in the military if you have any medical conditions that require constant treatment or excessive accommodation. That's why people with asthma, diabetes, permanent STD's/STI's (like HIV), people with cancer or a recurring history of cancer and individuals with physical disabilities can't serve (except in very rare cases where a specific waiver is granted). Transgender individuals require hormone replacement therapy, they require psychiatric care during transition, and if they elect to get surgery it can take 2-4 years for them to recover to the point of being eligible to deploy. On top of that, after the surgery they are at a higher risk of infection for the rest of their life, which complicates any attempt at sending them to the field to train where hygiene isn't always able to be pristinely maintained or overseas. An overseas deployment also puts the individual at risk because they may not have steady access to their hormone replacement drugs, which leads to withdrawal and hormone imbalances as well as health problems. So, just like diabetics and cancer patients and individuals with physical or mental disabilities, it just isn't feasible to accommodate these people so that they can serve",d0621a361f6
