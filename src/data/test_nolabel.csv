"We need to stop letting all and sundry into the UK and stop giving immigrants benefits as soon as they arrive. I don't mind people coming to this country from other countries as long as they have the money to fund themselves over here. If we went to another country we would have to have enough money to live for at least 5 years and wouldn't get any benefits from those countries either. If we didn't have the money then we wouldn't get in it's as simple as that. ALSO we need to add boundaries like if they have a criminal record no way would they get in, if they don't have the job specifications they wouldn't get in also that they would get NO benefits whatsoever for a minimum of 5 years (like Australia) and then you would only get benefits after the 5 year point if you have been working for those 5 years and you get basic benefits at that point and the longer you have worked the more you would be entitled too. If we brought in all those stipulations I would be fine with whoever came into this country as then I would know that they are not a drain on our economy. We are too nice to other minorities in this country and forget about our own people and their needs. We need to put our own people first and the other minorities second. ALSO we need to stop giving them monies for their children that are not even in this country also!!!!! EVERY minority that comes to this country should not be entitled to any free NHS, NO money from DSS, NO free housing etc they are the ones wanting to come to this country it's not as if we are begging them to come here so they can claim benefits it is their choice and most come to this country (NOT ALL) only want to come to the UK because of everything they get when they arrive. If we stopped handing out everything to them and gave them nothing you can bet probably 80% of those that want to come over here would not then want to come to this country as they wouldn't get all the handouts then and it is the handouts that they are loving and entice them here x",9232a431cf6

Amen. 26For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.",aa36db7675d

"Daily Mail (London) reports that a top Iman has told Muslims to use the migrant crisis to breed with European citizens and 'conquer their countries'. Sheikh Muhammad Ayed gave the speech at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem claiming Europe was only welcoming refugees as a new source of labour. He said Europe was facing a demographic disaster and urged Muslims to have children with westerners so they could 'trample them underfoot, Allah willing.' Birth rates are far higher in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, which is where most migrants are coming from.The notion of using mass migration as a form of stealth jihad is outlined in the Koran, which states, 'And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many locations and abundance.' To move to a new land in order to bring Islam is considered a meritorious GERMANY TODAY REVERSES WHAT MARTEL HAS WON FOR EUROPE. The Battle of Tours 1356, was fought on October 10, 732 between forces under the Frankish leader Charles Martel and a massive invading Islamic army led by Emir Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi Abd al Rahman, near the city of Tours, France. During the battle, the Franks defeated the Islamic army and Emir Abd er Rahman was killed. This battle stopped the northward advance of Islam from the Iberian peninsula, and is considered by most historians to be of macrohistorical importance, in that it halted the Islamic conquests, and preserved Christianity as the controlling faith in Europe, during a period in which Islam was overrunning the remains of the old Roman and Persian Empires. Now while ISIS is overrunning Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, Germany is opening its borders to Syrians, and thereby what Charles Martel achieved for Europe has been made fruitless. These migrants cannot be compared to WWII refugees, for they were Europeans and they had no hidden agenda either to propagate their religion or to indulge in terrorist activities, as Atta & Co., did on 9/11 after enjoying everything in the West.",98a4ca0432f

"I am taken aback by the negativity and ignorance on here from some contributors. Where is your humanity? How can you say, in all conscience, that we should not donate to help the refugees? I say, 'there but for the grace of God, go I' and I would hope, were I in their tragic situation, that kindness would prompt good people to help me and my family. Before you say to me that we should help our own first, I have done that, am doing that and will continue to do that in what ever way possible. I mention what follows purely to illustrate that I am not ignoring the need that exists here in this country. I am not blowing my own trumpet and I don't care what you think about me. I don't have a lot of money but I work and volunteer (including previously working for a homeless charity - my way of helping since I cannot donate huge cash amounts). I try to meet need where I find it in a small way. I have donated a gift filled shoe box for an elderly person in need; I am collecting tins of Christmas food for a food bank. I made a small donation to this collection - because it broke my heart watching the faces of the people struggling out of the sea and hearing their stories of people dying around them, and seeing the body of a little boy on the beach. Many of you sound angry. Anger is driven by fear. I'm frightened too - of the mess we're in here and in Syria and what might happen - but I will not let my fear turn me into someone who is incapable of helping others in desperate need - of what ever race or religion.

"Well, wherever I'm from, please justify how I'm racist? That's a nice argument coming from someone trying to muddy the waters between refugees and ""illegal immigrants"", I note with interest you haven't taken issue with my comments about Bulgarians... You'll note I also said ""most Europeans"" and compared refugees with professional beggars... you really should be careful about overreaction. For your information I'm an internationalist and see no reason for any borders (incidentally, neither do the rich or corporations, so why should the poor suffer them?) Yet again, you need a lesson in terminology and are missing the concept of refugee status. Immigrants are usually given indefinite leave to remain or a contractual period of time, refugees (such as the syrians coming to canada) will be given temporary leave to remain, and will as such be expected to return home as/when Syria is ""safe"". Syrians are not safe from war in Turkey, or have you missed the stories of multiple suicide bombings and revenge army attacks? Plus there's the point Turkey has as many refugees as the EU in a much smaller area... they're pushing on the Christian and Kurdish refugees. It's not schizophrenic, ""refugee"" is a legal term and Germany & Sweden have offered to take all Syrianss fleeing war. Hence, despite the legalities of entering Greece, as soon as they're registered they are legally refugees... until then let's say asylum seekers, as no one fleeing war or persecution shouldbe branded ""illegal"". As for Greece, Olga, sorry while I was attempting to prise a reaction from mr anonymous teacher there, i have nothing against Greeks, Bulgarians or Romanians per se, many Europeans do, and Bulgaria has elected a rather right-wing govt... Mr greek, As for dealing with these refugees, I do every week at work, and they're a friendly bunch that I've so far met... Vienna racist? :-D so the ""fluchtlinge wilkommen"" movement hasn't been reported then? While we're on the subject of history/historical places, shall we touch on the reasons the middle east is a shit storm now? Post WW1 the allies carved up the ottoman empire and drew lines in the earth to force people together in some areas where they hated each other, and apart in others where they potentially threatened western interests.... Cyprus is the largest testament to the active part the Greeks played in that theatre. Meanwhile, my family were enjoying a civil war in the Irish free state... easy to chuckaround labels, isn't it?

They are in NO danger, perceived or otherwise, while they are in Turkey, a country to which they initially sought refuge, so what are they seeking refuge away from by suffering so much to get into Greece and Europe? So who is promoting all this? The media and NGOs are all in subversive collusion against the very idea of ""nation"", never mind ""state"". There have been numerous wars in the middle east before.

"Ah, but there's a difference between doing ""what's best"", and doing something for political points. Did you know that this all started with the US House of Representatives arguing about whether Dept. of Defense funds should be used for gender reassignment surgery for transgender soldiers? Because it might have led to a bill failing, something Trump didn't want to keep happening, House Republicans turned to him to address the idea of such funding. So he said he was banning transgender people entirely. Not just the surgery. Not just those looking to seek surgery. The entire transgender population of the US military, which number in the thousands. Now I agree there's a hardy debate to be had about whether or not to use funds for such surgery, but the idea of using that as an opportunity to completely ban a group of people from serving is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There are transgender people right now serving in the US military not seeking surgery, nor taking regular hormone treatments. There are also people who have completed transitioning that don't need regular treatments. So these are able people that are being denied their privilege to serve their country, when it has been proven via a study performed by RAND Corp in 2016 that not only is the monetary burden negligible, but also proved through referencing other countries that openly have transgender people serving (like the UK) that there is no effect on morale or unit cohesion. I agree there are times to be doing things for the best even if some people don't like it (such as marriage equality being passed in the US two years ago), but you have to still do the work and learn whether it really is for the best, or if it's only to look good for certain people.",9ed71fdec4c

They are perfectly safe in Turkey where they initially find refuge from the war. When they leave Turkey to go to Europe, they are no longer running away from danger but are in search of a better life. That's understandable, but illegal nonetheless.

Trans people also tend to date other trans people, presumably because they understand each other's experience more than non-trans people. ... and if a trans woman thought you looked attractive, take it as a compliment mate, just as you would from any woman.

I may very likely be termed a cultural supremacist, but I am not racist at all, I think interbreeding is the best way to assure positive trajectory, mongrelisation assures greater vigour and superior genetics, as can be demonstrated in all animals.",6e3318c80dd

"THIS IS THE ONLY BIBLE PROPHECY LEFT TO BE FULFILLED. AND I SINCERELY WISH THAT IT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS. FOR THOSE WHO SAY TO ""BELIEVE"" ONLY IN JESUS' OWN WORDS, THESE ARE HIS. MATHEW 24:1-51 ""Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúDo you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.‚Äù Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, ‚ÄúTell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?‚Äù And Jesus answered and said to them: ‚ÄúTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, ‚ÄòI am the Christ,‚Äô and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. ‚ÄúThen they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name‚Äôs sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. ‚ÄúTherefore when you see the ‚Äòabomination of desolation,‚Äô spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place‚Äù (whoever reads, let him understand), ‚Äúthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect‚Äôs sake those days will be shortened. ‚ÄúThen if anyone says to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Christ!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThere!‚Äô do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. ‚ÄúTherefore if they say to you, ‚ÄòLook, He is in the desert!‚Äô do not go out; or ‚ÄòLook, He is in the inner rooms!‚Äô do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together. ‚ÄúImmediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. ‚ÄúNow learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near‚Äîat the doors! Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. ‚ÄúBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. ‚ÄúWho then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods. But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‚ÄòMy master is delaying his coming,‚Äô and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.""",760ca21471e

"You said ""God loves the people who listen to him and have high moral standards"". I encourage you to consider again. That sentence sounds like the legalism of the Pharisees, for whom people were either ""in"" or ""out"". They were deeply misguided in this and corrected by Jesus. You surely know John 3:16 ""For God so loved the WORLD"". What is the world? It is everyone. Not just those who know and serve God. The verse does not say ""God so loved the few who live in the right way."" If God's very nature is love, then by that very nature everyone is embraced by divine love. That means you, me, the vicar in the photo, the gay people marching or marrying, all the people posting here that say God does not exist. God loves even those who hate and reject God. Jesus tells us ""love your enemies"". A greatly respected and rarely practised teaching. Is God exempt from that advice? Studying the Bible and trying to live well are good things, but to be so, they simply flow out of love for God, knowing that: Grace means there is nothing I can do that makes God love me more. Grace means there is nothing I can do that makes God love me less. Faith is not a word describing adherence to a moral code. ""Now faith is confidence in what we hope for, and assurance about what we cannot see."" Hebrews 11. May you ""know as you are now known"". Peace to you.",aac1fce8c10

"The major thing I have learned from this'migrant-crisis' is that I now know where my vote will go in the forthcoming Referendum on the EU. I will vote to leave because, like many people here who won't admit it, the thought of the UK being in some 'club' with the Germans made many feel secure; the Germans, after-all, were the clever ones whose economy was up-and-away soon after WW2, while we lagged behind for many years. However, the way they have behaved over this crisis - handing out 'sweets' to migrants etc, is symbolic of their encouragement for the migrants to travel all that way; and absolutely ridiculous - and not a thought for their own people. It has now made my mind up, and I want to leave the EU",518ba00f6eb

Ans as far as ""Americans"" creating the problem, are you kidding? The middle east has been fighting the same ridiculous holy wars since the beginning of time. Did the governments including the UK create some of the issues concerning Isis absolutely. But are you all really so incredibly stupid to think that the average American who lives and works and has absolutely no political influence had anything to do with international relations or foreign affairs? Everybody's always picking on the Americans until they want something. This is in fact an invasion and how does it fall under the tag of invasion well the fact that they're literally just walking over other people to push their way into countries into which they do not live or have citizenship refusing to follow any of the laws and rules concerning gaining temporary and or permanent citizenship and are demanding to have the people who are actually citizens pushed over for their betterment. Starving people terrified people don't throw food water supplies and bite the hand that feed them they take the help they do what they can to get what they need for their families and they follow the rules.

"Eszter - I agree with you 100%, in the ideal world. But let's say everyone agrees to implement 100% border control at midnight tonight - with the numbers we are seeing, countries in eastern Europe will struggle to give the aid that is needed (even if the refugees were to behave and abide by the law). That is why I said about letting the ones moving get to Germany - so the burden falls on the country, or countries that can handle it, until the UN takes over. As for genuine refugees vs illegal immigrants... that is another reason to pass the problem on to Germany, because eastern Europe couldn't undertake the burden of repatriating the illegals. The only way to fix the problem is stop the flow at source, and let the rest get to somewhere better equipped. Your second concern (about knowing who is who, and where they are) is a major issue for Europe that I feel will come back to haunt Europe. I believe Hungary have already arrested at least one member of ISIS, so how many more have just disappeared - and even without the terrorist threat, how many ""undesirables"" or criminals have taken the opportunity to simply vanish? As I said before the situation descended into a great big cluster fk - compassion is one thing, but it looks like western Europe totally lost it's mind, and didn't think a single thing through.",9f881317e4d

"What does the word Humanity mean? It means to love, to care, to show compassion, to practice and preach helping each other in our emotional and physical times of distress. To show acceptance and respect towards each other as fellow living beings (for all living beings). These essential and natural elements of humanity existed and come to existence much before man made ideas, practices, beliefs and expectations (religions, societies, mythologies, ideologies, etc.) A child of any species first takes birth as a living being, belonging to him/her/it self first and foremost later on the families, societies, communities and ourselves start identifying with something or the other- in most cases it's a clever imposition. This child that takes birth as itself is taking birth as a living being and the only thing it truly belongs to is it's own inner light- inner compassion, inner love and humanity. Today in the USA, Humanity has won over regressive ideas, beliefs, emotions and feelings of hatred, disrespectfulness, segregation and discrimination. Congratulations to us all to be a part of a society and country that believes in 'Inclusion' and not 'exclusion'. We need to understand everything in nature, is Natural! Now that the LGBTQ community has been embraced with open arms and humanity, we should make attempts and take strong steps in providing equality to other minority groups or groups being sidelined- we should open ourselves towards understanding and embracing groups belonging to all skin colors (African Americans, Asians, Caucasians, etc.), genders, mental and physical limitations, animals rights, children's rights, etc. A historical day in the U.S. and the world today.

"ummmm Key Findings There were 698,512 live births in England and Wales in 2013, a decrease of 4.3% from 729,674 in 2012. In 2013, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) decreased to 1.85 children per woman, from 1.94 in 2012. In 2013 the stillbirth rate fell to 4.7 per thousand total births, from 4.9 in 2012. The average age of mothers in 2013 increased to 30.0 years, compared with 29.8 years in 2012. Over a quarter (26.5%) of live births were to mothers born outside the UK; a small increase compared with 25.9% in 2012. Get all the tables for this publication in the data section of this publication . http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2013/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2013.html But i understand you got that information from the DailyMail article published around the same time. Furthermore, Latest figures from the ONS show there are now 521,000 Polish-born residents of the UK - up from 75,000 in 2003. It makes the Poles the biggest UK community by foreign nationality - and the second (after India) by country of birth. The figures came out as part of the comprehensive annual population survey, which (at least until the census results emerge next year) give us a real insight in the demographics of Britain. http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/26/foreign-born-uk-population Another source more recently and academic as well that backs up those numbers. That the highest foreign national births in the UK belong to India then Poland , followed by Pakistan and third, fourth and fifth is also occupied by EU member states. http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/migrants-uk-overview I propose to you sir based on your comnent that you are a bigot on the basis that you have an issue that apparently children being born in the UK belong to ""foreigners"" I.e. none whites so yeah it is prejudicial and has no room in our society.

Sadly though, if you just Google ""country with highest rapes"" the top page you'll see is Wikipedia: Rape Statistics - and here is an excerpt from that page : - In Australia the reported rape rate per 100,000 people is relatively high, although it is in a decreasing trend, coming down from 91.6 in the year 2003 [28] to 28.6 in 2010.[29] This stands in contrast to reported rape rate of 1.2 per 100,000 in Japan, 1.8 per 100,000 in India, 4.6 rapes per 100,000 in Bahrain, 12.3 per 100,000 in Mexico, 24.1 per 100,000 in United Kingdom, 28.6 per 100,000 in United States, 66.5 per 100,000 in Sweden, and world's highest rate of 114.9 rapes per 100,000 in South Africa.[28][29] - This sadly making Sweden the number one rape country in Europe, only to be surpassed by South Africa. But it shocks me that not more women are fighting against the fact that Sweden has the SECOND highest rate of rape IN THE FUCKING WORLD!!! I mean, with all these feminist movements and political groups we have in Sweden not ONE actually addresses the most hideous crime that a woman can ever be subjected to?! What the hell is wrong with people??? Stand up for your sisters in your own country instead of denying the facts and instead protecting the thousands of men that thrive on this rape culture...

I don't think the threat to Europe is going to be from refugees coming in from Iraq or Syria. If ISIS manages to blow something up in the UK it will be a British or another EU national who will be carrying out these activities. I would assume that any refugee coming in the country would have some tight surveillance on them. What ISIS wants is division because that works in their favour. The more division the easier it is to convince people that there is a big difference between us and them. The more hate crime the more the propaganda will work. So what we can do is show how ridicilous ISIS and other radical groups are. A school program will have to be included in school to teach muslims and non-muslims how groups like ISIS are at crossroads with Islamic teachings. The majority of people killed by ISIS are muslim and they are burning muslim town after town in Syria. Also programs outside school are needed to educate muslims and non-muslims about Islam and to clarify certain scriptures that are causing confusing. Such programs have already started but of course we need to see more. Muslims have been a lot more active in explaining to others about Islam after recent events. So yes education is key.,e4cdaaa1c19

"We have huge immigration in Canada as well. I'm not certain but I believe we welcome more immigrants to Canada than any other country. Our gov't tells us that we need immigration to replace our ""aging population"" as our birthdate is below the replacement rate. However I'm beginning to question the real motivation for why mass immigration is continually rammed down our throats. We can't even have a decent debate without accusations of racism- never mind the fact that immigrants come in white too. I'm beginning to believe that immigration does more harm than good in the short-term and it negatively impacts ""natives"" and even the second generation of long-established immigrants. First of all, while many immigrants are highly skilled/educated, we must ask why do we import skilled people?? Why are we no longer offering affordable training/post-secondary schooling to ""natives""? In Canada and the U.S., the costs of tuition is becoming more and more prohibitive and burdensome. It's not as ""easy"" for everyone to take on massive debts, that could take decades (yes, in some cases decades) to pay off. And why don't our governments care if its own people are educated?? Because keeping people ignorant and desperate means that they will tow the line. Govt's MUST invest in their own people and stop importing foreigners trained ""specialists."" Here in Canada we are experiencing wage stagnation and the loss of unionization. Somehow the average Canadian has been hoodwinked into believing that unions are useless and costly- even the U.S. has higher rates of unionization than us, albeit their union population is shrinking also. Immigrants tend to come from countries where a unionized workforce is unheard of and worker/human rights violations are rampant! So these people come here and, admittedly, they are willing to work the crap jobs that the average Canadian won't take. Why won't the average Canadian take these low-pay Wal-Mart jobs? Because one can barely survive on the wages!! The unskilled immigrants are usually desperate enough to take any work and they will do it without complaint. This allows our govts and businesses to keep the pay for low-skilled jobs at barely sustenance levels where people will likely never be able to seek out the training/education required to move up the societal rungs and it is increasingly likely that they never be able to put their children through college on such meager wages. However the fact that immigrants will ""happily"" do these crappy jobs, in turn makes the ""hard working"" immigrant laudable compared to the natives who are accused of being ""too proud"" to do low pay wirk. then the people who blindly support unfettered immigration, and accuse those who call for restraint ""racists"" and ""bigots"". Unskilled immigrants are not your ""heroes"" because they take on our shit work; often they are people who are used to poor, oppressive working conditions so they'll do the work that no one else wants. So in sum, our governments want to import two kinds of immigrants to the detriment of ""native"": ready-made skilled immigrants so that they can keep domestic tuitions expensive and out of reach for their own people. And the unskilled immigrants will do the crappy jobs because they have no choice and the odds are that Canada's shitty jobs are an improvement from third world factory work. I'm not any-immigration. But we need to fix domestic problems before we simply import disadvantaged people to do our slave work for us. Question the REAL reasons why our governments and big business love mass immigration. Is it really in everyone's best interest??",2ee382acd03
"Tihomir, you are indeed correct. As the picture is beginning to clear, the vast majority of the immigrants are not from war torn Syria.

Moreover, very few are genuine refugees; even under the outdated conventions, as they have already passed through a number of safe havens e.g. Turkey.",299ebfe2091

After 3 years 87% of Syrians are still unemployed. More than half of all non-western immigrants are on welfare. Somalis have an unemployment rate of over 80%.

"Hey, this was posted on Sunday at 4:38, by James aleo. Look up the comments: ""Some of the comments on this thread are really showing exactly why it is so difficult for people to come out still. I agree that my sex life is my own business, but my sexuality does not begin and end with sex. My partner and I live in the wider world, where no heterosexual person had to hide their sexuality, and can walk down the street holding hands, or give their partner a peck on the cheek when seeing them off at the railway station without fear of comment or disapproval, we have to watch our backs all the time if we wish to show each other the affection anyone else can do without fear. I have been the victim of abuse because of my sexuality more than once, and i think most LGBTQ people I know have. Legislation goes some way to refreshing the balance, but while some people still hold the opinion that we should hide who we are in public it will always be difficult. My sexuality is no one else's business, but I'm not going to hide it to make anyone else feel better either.""

"So, to take your points in turn: 1) There was a study performed by RAND Corp. in 2016 to determine the effects of having transgender people in the military, and the cost was determined to be negligible. So, ultimately, ""cutting corners"" is not really all that necessary in this situation. 2) That study also examined several other military forces around the world that have transgender people enlisted and found no significant instances of loss of unit cohesion or morale. 3) That same study again noted that the number of transgender people serving between 1320 and 6630. It's tough to get an accurate number because it's not something the DoD really tracks, but some estimates put it above 10,000. That's not proven, though. At any rate, I think the important thing is that for people serving in the military, beyond gender, beyond race, beyond background, beyond sexuality, you are first a soldier. It's one of the first things you learn there. As long as leadership is in place, then any gender, sexuality, or gender identity can serve alongside each other. No, it's not going to be perfect, and yes, there will probably be incidents, but I applaud these folks for their voluntary service. I certainly didn't have the fortitude. Here's the study, if you're interested: https://www.rand.org/news/press/2016/06/30.html",7805b7d8c12

"Sally-Ann & Margaret Hume. You clearly don't get what I was saying & quite frankly, what filthy language you use on social media. There's no fraternising in barracks during training process which lasts a year. Man & Women are separated for the training process. Also, the reason a man has less time to run x miles or is required to to x more than a women, is because men are naturally stronger than women. So if a man becomes a woman, he's still got the male structure & strength regardless if he's decided to stick some tits in & wearing makeup. He's still a man. Also, i never claimed to be a highly desirable man to any sex. I simply said that that there's a reason man & woman are separated & a man transitioned to a woman, will have a significant advantage over other women. It's why transgender will not be able to compete in sports. Because a man still has the strength & physique of a man regardless to what he tries to become. Men run faster, hit harder & perform better than women, because men have a higher level of fitness, strength & stamina than women. So putting a man now a women with women to compete is unfair to women born as a woman. Call me whatever names you like. You are & will always be the sex your born as. There's no way to physically prove your a women trapped in a mans body, yet it's had laws written for it. Stupid!",8120ca17b4f

Hungary is making things worst. The migrants want to come to Germany or Scandinavia. No one wants to stay in Hungary. Hungarians are doing this simply out of xenophobia and hatred. After all they support Putin. As for the intervention against ISIS - I fully agree. It should already have been done. This is where the problem originates from. NATO should take the firmer position in this matter.,12aab8fd795

What makes your statement so sad is that you believe that it's restricted in some way to Romanians only. Swedish natives create enough crime on their own, with or with out any help from immigrants. The problem in Sweden is that SD have managed to spread the word, to enough voters, to convince them that it's because of immigration, religion and anyone who looks different then the normal Sweed.

"1. There are 49 countries where the majority of people are Muslim. There are only 7 countries that have a major portion of their laws under Sharia: Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Brunei. So the majority of muslim countries do not have Sharia law and those that do do not have full out Sharia. 2. There is no one type of muslim. Same as there is no one type of Jew, Christian or Atheist. There are moderates, liberals and radicals. Pretty much all the ground troops fighting ISIS are muslim and nearly all the people that ISIS kills are muslim. As shown above, the majority of countries do not have Sharia law so the majority of muslims are not radicals. So there is no one group of muslims. Same as the fact that there is no one group of christians. Not all christians are part of the KKK. Although all KKK members are Christian. 3. The west have been at the forefront of giving power to the radicals. They financed and supported al qaeda against the Russians in Afghanistan. They illegal occupied iraq, a country that had no presence of al qaeda or ISIS before the invasion, putting in policies that banned pretty much the army, councillors and police officers allowing for al qaeda to enter Iraq and cause havoc. The west continually supports Saudi Arabia, a big funder of extremists organisations. Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest purchasers of western weapons and therefore they are the untouchables. The middle east has payed the price for this. There are many factors that have resulted in the mess were are in and the West's middle east policy is one of them. 4. Most religious books contain practices that may not be applicable to our society. For example within the old testament: Murder Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must be put to death. Such evil must be purged from Israel. (Deuteronomy 17:12 NLT) Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be put to death. (Exodus 21:15 NAB) Sex Slaves - check out Exodus 21:7-11 NLT The majority of all muslims believe that some parts of the quran are specific to past events and should not be applied to today. A lot is story telling. The same thing applies to Christianity and Judaism. So, similar to most Jews and Christians, Muslims also live their lives not adhering to these things. There are 2.8bn muslims. If they all thought that suicide bombing is a duty against the infidels then our world wouldn't exist and there would only be 100% muslim countries with no minorities. I can only imagine what would happen if the Christian Spanish inquisition or the crusades occurred today and was picked up by social media and shown to us. It would cause a shitsorm and Christians would be the target of hate groups. All we would see and talk about is Christian terrorism.",367f6c6b218

"To be fair the UK has a very high gay population and the UK have been one of the first countries to recognize and understand the LGBT communities it has been more of a taboo topic in the united States until recently .. You also have to add in the factors that the UK and Europe are athiest countries and don't believe in God and it's the immigrants who are living in the UK that actually keep God alive and attend mosque, churches etc .. In the united states people are still very religious and attend a place of worship weekly .. And it's not because they are transgendered that's the problem .. The problem is how to get hormone therapy treatments ( which is a life long commitment ) on to the battle fields and across the seas when you are doing your tour of duty ? Being without the medication the transgender needs can be a dangerous situation that's what the concerns are about not them being transgenders . the military also doesn't let people who don't finish high school , or people with face and neck tatoos or people with mental illnesses or health problems into the military so if a guy who was trans and couldn't get his hormone pills could become suicidal and that is a mental state that could endanger the troops .. We have to look at every issue for the safety and well being of all lives ..",889c8eec2dc

".. Uhm ""my country/citizenship/nationslity/identity"" is Canadian, not Greek. I'm glad you showed everyone how you think in labels and racist terms. For your information, I'm 3rd generation Canadian actually, and using a Greek name on Facebook is because I teach Greek and English and don't want students finding me easily on Facebook, and secondarily because of my ancestry which you were so eager to observe duh. The fact that you actually decided to publicly attack and deride Greeks for what their country is going through regarding their economy, just because you ASSumed I'm Greek (as though Greeks don't have a right to tell people what is objectively true or not just because, as you said their economy is in tatters), when in actuality we are talking about: a) refugees and Syrians fleeing their country into Turkey where they are safe from war and b) their illegal immigration into Greece and Europe, and c) whether the media should continue to label illegal immigrants as refugees, is utterly schizophrenic in your part my friend and proves exactly how terribly messed up your way of thinking really is. As for Greeks, since you mention, given the fact that about 10,000 have died due to the economic crisis, and over 200,000 have legally immigrated due to the economic downturn also, that's all the more reason not to compound the Greek problems and incapacity to offer help by burdening Greece with the largest number of illegal immigrants in Europe. I seriously doubt that American people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that French people are to blame for their mess. I seriously doubt that Greeks are to blame for the mistakes and betrayal if their politicians and the stupid laws they pass and agreements they made and borrowed money they used. You are a dumb, ignorant bastard. I hope all the ""refugees"" come to your posh neighborhood in Austria. Then you will stfu. You are a bigoted racist. ==== Canada will accept mostly immigrants. The media, and morons like you, will keep calling them refugees because it's a sexier news headline. Enjoy Vienna built only in Greek style architecture. One of the most racist and Nazi cities in Europe, and the only country in Europe that has received the LEAST number of immigrants labeled refugees... It's easy for you to judge ask other countries.. I hope you are deported back to Britain by Austrian authorities so that your place is given to a Syrian family in need. They need it more than you do anyway, and have far more grounds to immigrate to Austria than you did, in your logic.",90054dfa476

"The complexity of this issue- who benefits, who loses from mass immigration into the UK- is almost never rationally and dispassionately debated. We are up against human nature.

As posts here indicate we are all of us always ""patrolling the boundaries of the normal"" (a phrase that I read somewhere that fits) and looking to exclude someone from our good graces. This issue touches on people's deepest instincts and upon their sense of their identify and for many (righty or wrongly) it's felt as an attack upon their ability to earn a wage. My instinct is that immigration brings a net benefit- in a variety of ways- but I recognise that there are costs, too. And as a salaried and housed middle class man I don't pay those costs. Both sides in this argument must desist from name-calling and look to debate the evidence rationally",fa0a60152e1

Also you point of refugees going to the other countries in Europe is not valid. Germany said that it will accept 800k. So why wouldn't you go to such a country who has the infrastructure to take you in and make use of your skills. Why would anyone stay in Hungary? have you seen how they have treated the refugees? Like animals. A couple of questions regarding Syrians being cowards that I hope you can answer: 1. Who are the Syrian people supposed to push out? Bashar/government? Al Qaeda? ISIS? or the hundred other rebel factions fighting? 2. Where are you supposed to get the money to buy the weapons? Did your grandparents find the weapons under their house or were they supplied by your government? 3. Would you keep your family under ISIS control while you are fighting? Would you take the risk that your child may be taken away at any moment or that an airstrike will come and kill the whole family? 4. Are all refugees leaving war cowards? Are Jews cowards for leaving Germany? 5. ISIS knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians. 6. The government knocks on your door and tells you come with us now you need to fight or we kill your family. What do you do? This also means killing civilians.

"Just to clarify I am not muslim so this is not MY religion. I have had the chance to live in Iraq (half my life), UAE and the UK so I have tiptoed into both worlds ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô. Delina: i think the most important thing you have to question is whether muslims believe that these things you mentioned apply today or whether they apply at all. 1. The whole muhammad marrying Aysha at the age of 9 is debated heavily within the muslim community itself. Some say she wasn‚Äôt 9. Even if she was we need to remember that we are talking about 1,400 years ago where there are numerous cases of such things happening within that region. Most importantly, do muslims marry 9 year olds. Rarely. I‚Äôve only heard of cases in Egypt and Saudi. So muslims do not agree with this and it rarely occurs. 2. Nearly all muslims believe that the whole slavery thing is misinterpreted. People interpret it as during war when you come across women do not make them the untouchables and that you should marry them if you want (marriage in the quran requires both consents) and treat them equally. With regards to other slaves, muslims believe that their prophet brought a lot of new rights to salves, changing the roman slavery rules. In addition, a lot of slaves were freed. A lot of the things I have read confirm this. 3. The whole marrying 4 i think was there to spread Islam. I have never come across anyone in my life that has married more than 1 and tbh it only happens in some societies like Saudia Arabia. Nearly all muslims marry 1 person. So again applicable then and not now. 4.Women rights. The whole covering your self completely is simply incorrect. Quran requires you to be modest and not for full out covering. It‚Äôs more of a culture thing (or should i say a tribal thing) plus people used to wear it for protection from the sand. I am not joking when I say this but during my 13 years in Baghdad i saw less burkas than in my 3 years in London. In the society I lived in, all my friends' muslim moms went to uni, had jobs and lived equally to men. Within the same families you can find women covering their hair and some that don't. Different interpretation of modesty. This is in Iraq, UAE and the UK. Saudi Arabia is not how the majority of muslim women live and really does not represent Islam. FGM for example again only happens in some societies and not across the muslim world. In fact its mostly an african thing and happens a lot in non-muslim countries. 5. Your statement that muslims have only brought misery to the west is a bit extreme. you have put Sunnis, Shias, Alawites, Whabasim, Ahmadeyia, Druze and many others all in one group. Muslim immigration has worked wonderfully in some situations and haven‚Äôt worked in other situations. This depends on a lot of factors such as the people coming to the west, the people receiving the immigrants, the programs in place to connect both. For examples, there are so so many muslims in the NHS. If we are going through the route of blaming the whole group then the middle east can say the same about the west. The west has only brought misery to the middle east, from the Sykes-Picot agreement, to the overthrow of the Iranian government in 1953, to supporting Saddam, supporting Al qaeda against the russions, illegally occupying Iraq, supplying weapons to the Syrian rebels, giving weapons to Qaddafi and then taking him out and supporting countries with extreme ideologies. How many dictators have the west supported? Should we block all the west from entering the middle east. Should we build walls around every country in the world. So the misconception people have with Islam is to do with the Quran. Do muslims apply certain verses to their everyday life or do they think that some verses only apply to the past with some parts being story telling. The quran is in arabic, written 1,400 years ago, so are we interpreting the quran correctly? I am sure how things were said 1400 years ago is different to how we speak now. In my experience, most of the muslims i know, and I know a lot given that i used to live in Iraq and the UAE, agree that some versers are not applicable today or they interpret those verses differently.

Why are they still calling them migrants ? Someone trying to break into your home you would not call a visitor would you ? You'd call them a criminal. Someone trying to cross into your country illegally is not a migrant. These people were refugees when they landed in Greece or Italy. Possibly fleeing a war zone and possibly just trying to get to a better country for their own interests. If they decide to leave these two lands (which aren't at war or persecuting them) because benefits are better in other countries they then become illegal immigrants.

"Not really. There's 2.5 million that entered a Greece of a 10 million population in a very short year and a half, with a much as half a million arriving in the last few months spine, accounting for 1/4th of its population all on small islands with towns half that of the size of Moncton. That's like saying by analogy 10 million people came to Canada all within a few months in the smallest of towns. If that had happened here, you'd be crying like a petty spoiled whiner that you are for not being able to drive through the streets. So stop being naive. This is as much a crisis for the illegal immigrants as it is for those locals whose lives they are destroying. You have it easy, and you pick and choose sides too easily based on your preconceived notions. There's utter chaos in these circumstances and nothing is cut and dry. What is more, there's evidence these people are being urged to immigrate into Europe instead of dispersing in the surrounding vicinity of their country that is safe and where they are welcome and where they don't have to travel for 1800 km and pay smugglers 5 thousands euros per head to get to Europe when they're not even running away from danger any longer. Worse yet, countries like UAE, which are Muslim, wealthier than Germany and Greece and Italy and France combined, and a mere 200 km away from Syria have closed their borders to their Muslim brothers. To give you a sense of how irrationally wild it is that they specifically want to come to Greece, get this: Iraq is roughly the same distance: 1890 km from Greece. Where are all the Iraqis from the war there? What about all the Palestinians? They are closer. What about all the Egyptians? They could have just skipped over the sea onto Crete when there was war in their country, but hardly anyone came. What about people from Jordan, they are closer too. Where are they? Libyans didn't come to Greece either. So what's up with Syrians? They are neither the first nor the last to have war. What's the deal with this mass exodus of only males? When the war in Bosnia took place, none came to Greece and they are much much closer by a few hundred km. When the war in Kosovo broke out, no one came either nor dispersed into Europe. When the war in Ukraine came, hardly any mass migration took place. When the war in Yugoslavia took place that created FYROM and the such, hardly anyone moved about yet again. The scenario with Syrians is a first in recent history. Don't be so naive. All these men are draft dodgers too. They should be fighting for their country as they are able bodied, young and healthy. Who will rebuild their nation. At best I find this mass exodus suspiciously curious for destabilizing both Syria and Europe.

"Thanks for your comment and I partially agree with you. I am also glad to see that a conversation is possible even if we have different views. There may be a law against a fence which I dont know about but I doubt that there is. If I am wrong and there is why is there a fence in Calais? If there is no law then Hungary didnt breach the law migrants can still enter the border and go through registration. Prior to this I was also thinking that the problem is in Greece but looking at the situation in Hungary and they sheer amount of people I can see why the fragile Greek economy cannot protect its borders and register people. To be honest they needed help well before this happened. And yes, the fence is not an answer on the long term and I dont think it will be up if the situation can be controlled in any other more sensible ways. However, people break through polce lines and it is physicaly impossible to establlish border control without it. You will soon see that people enter your country getting into Croatian citizens gardens and blocking train stations and motorways and making it impossible for people to go to work for example. Also what is really sad that Hungary has been criticised by Croatia that we were not prepared and Croatia will handle the situation better and look what happened! I still hope that a common solution will be found and neighbourhing countries will not turn on each other.
