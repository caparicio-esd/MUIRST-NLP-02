Migrants are fleeing from the ISIS and middle east conflicts; 2. They entered the EU in Greece without being checked; 3. They were invited by Ms Merkel, as at the time Germany saw a chance to seek cheep labor force; 4. Hungary erects walls. The law says that the refugees should be registered in the country they enter first. This is neither Croatia nor Hungary. It is Greece or Turkey. Were they registered in Greece? No! They either stayed in Turkey (circa 1.8 Mil) or moved forward to Europe. There is nowhere in the EU or international law stated that borders should be protected by walls and fences? And yet, Hungary is building like crazy. Number of refugees heading for Germany exceeds German needs, so it is possible that they will no longer be welcomed in Germany. This means that they will stuck in Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia or Serbia, waiting to be properly registered and transported to other countries (e.g. USA and Canada offered no more than 130.000 places). At this point it is clear that all countries en route to Germany are not conforming with the international law requirements. The only way for Croatia to deal with the situation is by simply transferring them as soon as possible to the end destination. Unlike Hungary, Croatia does that humane. Well done Mr Milanovic. Last and most important - this migration problem cannot be handled by one country by itself. The problem needs to be resolved politically within the NATO, with the clear call for the full scale military action against ISIS. With the emphasis on ""full scale"" and ""military"".

Basically everyone has failed eastern Europe. 1) The refugees should not have left the countries they escaped to - the UN should have made sure they stayed in the camps, and were registered. 2) Merkel basically sent out an invite to a free party in Germany, and slammed the door in the faces of people who turned up, because her house was full. 3) With nowhere to go, the refugees were stuck in Hungary, who quickly worked out they couldn't handle the numbers, so did the same as Germany, and stopped them coming in... thus pushing the problem further back down the line. The problem is when you plug one hole in a dam, it doesn't stop the pressure building up, it will just break out somewhere else - like Croatia or Serbia. So Eastern Europe as a whole is in a no-win situation - if you individually keep them out, you are called inhumane, even if you can't cope with the burden. If you decide to let them through, you are technically breaking the law. The solution I proposed was let those already moving go to Germany and register, and ensure those in camps or those leaving Syria stay in the camps and register. The UN will then be able to oversee their rights are upheld (shelter and food - even if that means camps in Germany, Austria etc.), or that the refugees are resettled as appropriate. However the only way that would work is if it is a temporary solution, and the refugees are able, and actively encouraged to return home at the earliest opportunity. {As it happens, the paraphrasing still turned out to be quite long - sorry :) }",845d4b7311c,1641,299,12,0,False,False,4.491638795986622,25.0,1641

""The Swedish police record each instance of sexual violence in every case separately, leading to an inflated number of cases compared to other countries. Sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For example, in 2005 Sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider, which led to a marked increase in reports."" ""Additionally, the Swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases, in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases."" ""According to the FRA study there's a strong correlation between higher levels of gender equality and disclosure of sexual violence. This, and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships, may also explain the relatively high rates of reported rape in Sweden, which has a long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established women's movement, and has been ranked as the number one country in sex equality."" tl;dr: Learn a little about data interpretation, don't reach conclusions based purely on assumptions, and always, always read texts/Wikipedia pages (at least the parts related to the subject of discussion) in their entirety; especially if you're using them as references to back up your claims.",9f253b3f383,1822,282,11,0,False,False,5.464539007092198,25.636363636363637,1822

You have called our attention to brush up our memory, now I'd like to ask You to do the same. ;-) In 1956 the Hungarians immediately after crossing the border e.g. to Austria they went to the local authorities and co-operated with them. The Hungarians stayed in the refugee-camp as long as they were ordered to do so and left the camps only when they were allowed to. The Hungarians have used their passports to identify themselves and have accepted the registration process. The Hungarians have left the refugee-camps only to that country which accepted them upon their registration data. The Hungarians did not attack the border/fence/soldiers/policemen etc of other countries but they did everything to follow the rules and traditions of the given foreign country. And at last there were only 200.000 Hungarians, while there are 4.000.000 Syrian refugees. The Syrian refugees do not stay in their neighbour countries but they move toward to other countries upon their guess and without any documents. They cross green borders without permit and they do not want to use the OPEN border stations, although those are OPEN. They do not want themselves to be registrated and do not want to stay in the refugee-camps. Instead of co-operating with the local authorities, they attack the borders and the policemen. They do not stay in refugee-camps and do not accept any help (food, drink etc) from the local authorities and churches but money. They do not use even the provided waste bins, but they simply throw their litter to everywhere. They do not want to follow the local law and traditions but show aggressive behaviour. I accept that their norms are different to ours, and that there is a big cultural difference.

We follow the tradition of Roman law because the traditional power structures of western civilization emerged from the Roman society. One of the keys to understanding how to have Christ’s power in your life may be to accept the actions of others without attempting to use civil government to punish the offender, which is accepted by scholars as a system of human justice implemented to prevent individuals from seeking revenge independently. Remember, Christ said, “judge not, that ye be not judged, I shall repay saith the Lord of Hosts.” No person will find it easy to ignore those who purposefully take advantage of them, but those who choose to emulate Christ, by caring for others, avoiding greed and materialism, and refusing to harm others may actually be able to call on Christ aid in time of need; this would be helpful when facing climate change.",bd0ec054dd1,1309,223,6,0,False,False,4.874439461883408,37.166666666666664,1309

I also see the struggles they have. These people want their home lands and their families, they don't want to be westernised and their culture made irrelevant. Many also suffer from PTSD and suffer on a daily basis. I had one man who was suicidal because he was unable to provide for his family in his home country and he could not contact family in UN camps apart from one member whom he was told would not be leaving the camp. This man cannot fit into a foreign society and do all he needs to to do this successfully when he cannot cope with his immense loss. IMHO I sincerely think we need to stop looking at these situations from our own points of reference and look at them from their perspective. What do they want and need. It's not being displaced and moved to foreign lands with little to no family. You see, cultures outside of western influence appear to value family relationships much more than we do. Look around us at our neighbours - the only extended families are those immigrants who could afford to come her and wanted to. Instead of putting a bandage on a haemorrhage, why don't we fix the problem. Instead of spending all that money to resettle people all around the world, why don't governments join together to despose those in power and causing this crisis. It wold make more sense to get rid of the problem and let people live in their country with their culture and family. I have much more thought on this but this is the gist of it. At the end of the day we westerners do what we would want, maybe we should ask what they want and need. cheers",759e0ece8fb,1760,327,18,0,False,False,4.385321100917431,18.166666666666668,1760

I just want to add that if Hungary didn't send the migrants to Germany or put a stop on numbers passing through Hungary by enforcing border controlls nobody would have taken it seriously till to this day. My biggest concern is that according to current estimates only 20-30% of the will get refugee status and those who won't will be asked to return home. I am not sure if you have seen the reaction when people were stopped and asked to register but you could see lots aggression and violence. What will happen when they are encouraged to go home? I can't even imagine their reactions. And will they? The EU is notoriously bad at returning refugees to their country of origin. I am still thinking border control is the way forward but not only in Hungary but all the way along. If we suppose that they can return to their countries after it is safe then refugees must be helped (by the enitre EU) as close to their home as possible. Also it would discourage those who are not running from war to stay at home and dont risks their life. If you cannot protect the border you soon won't be able to protect not even EU citizens but the real refugees who need help. My other problem is that at this stage EU is talking about quotas, migrants and refugees and to be frank we don't even know who is who and have estimated numbers at this point. Why do we have to transport people to Germany and find out there that they are not even refugees then retunr them back? It is not fair on them and not fair on the EU. And a side note..... it would be great to see some balanced reporting in the media as well and not making the situation worse by picking on certain countries like Hungary when to be honest nobody can handle the situation.",230be3bc4d6,1815,345,16,0,False,False,4.263768115942029,21.5625,1815

If they see that somehow getting to the EU will enable them to go to Germany they will try their luck. As much as I am aware of a train was stopped many times in Germany by pulling the emergency handle and migrants jumpped off the train and disappeared. How can you make sure that they will go back then? I still think that we can bring the ""equipment"" to the people rather than the people to the equipment. Costs less time and money. I am not sure if it was a really a terrorist or not so I cannot comment on that, I heard about it but I am really not sure how reliable the info is. There is certainly a risk and that is why I am saying stop everyone where they are and find out there and then. If the EU is one unit it doesn't matter so the funds and resources can go to where the problem is. I also think that Germany should take more responisbilty about the situation due to the message that was sent out (funnily enough that was a rather vague statment which now can be altered according to the situation - but lets move on about it) Than it is possible to talk about quotas and numbers.

The Islamic religion is going through a similar scenario of extremists like Christianity did as well as probably all religions (over generalizing but you get the point, hopefully).

There are other factors such as the loss of identity a country goes through - a country with reduced population at that, which would see its ethnic composition warped, and the economic impact it would have. But for the most part, these people are worried about their country - a free, liberal, modern country with freedom of expression having its identity warped by the ascension of radical, intolerant forms of religion, by people who refuse to integrate and embrace another culture.

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but if you can't cut it in training then they prevent you from entering into combat. So if a woman or transgender individual can pull as much weight as a typical male soldier and passed the same psych exams, then why can't they serve any role? Don't get me wrong, I acknowledge that there is a physical strength difference. But again, those who don't pass the test won't be able to serve in active combat, as it should be. Anybody who isn't physically fit or mentally fit should not be allowed. And for anybody that says transgender people are mentally ill, there are plenty of studies that say otherwise. If something is considered a mental illness, it usually has to effect the person who is suffering from it, from what I've seen so far, the only people suffering from this whole issue are the ones that for some reason or another hate those who are transgender, and yes transgender people suffer as well, but it is usually because of bigots and not because something they themselves have done.",7b864e2a9b2,1307,240,9,0,False,False,4.45,26.666666666666668,1307

As far as refugees or refugee crisis is concerned, It is the laws of the European Union and the west that allow refugees enter into their territory. The same happens in the US. Mr. Ty Royce Weldon has criticised Islam strongly. Either he does not have complete information regarding it or media has brainwashed him strongly, because media shows him only what is seen by the eyes of the camera. In reality Islam never says you must force someone to convert to Islam, never allows a person to kill another human being, never allows to steal from another person, never allows to even enter the house of another person without his permission, etc. We need to respect the opinion of one another rather than critcise a whole religion. If we are used to the media and the media says that suicide bomber was a muslim from this so-called country, we directly believe it because seeing is believing, however the media never said that he was given a million dollars to carry out this bombing in a certain state, either european or asian, or that he was bought by ten million dollars and a ferrari or citiZenship of a specific well developed country. There are thousands of thousands of immigrants and refugees in Europe and the US who have embraced the customs and laws of these regions and who have never tried to impose anything upon a European or an American.

Transgender individuals require hormone replacement therapy, they require psychiatric care during transition, and if they elect to get surgery it can take 2-4 years for them to recover to the point of being eligible to deploy. On top of that, after the surgery they are at a higher risk of infection for the rest of their life, which complicates any attempt at sending them to the field to train where hygiene isn't always able to be pristinely maintained or overseas. An overseas deployment also puts the individual at risk because they may not have steady access to their hormone replacement drugs, which leads to withdrawal and hormone imbalances as well as health problems.
